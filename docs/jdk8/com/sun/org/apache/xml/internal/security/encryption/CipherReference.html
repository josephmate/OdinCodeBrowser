/**
 * &lt;code&gt;CipherReference&lt;/code&gt; identifies a source which, when processed,
 * yields the encrypted octet sequence.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The actual value is obtained as follows. The &lt;code&gt;CipherReference URI&lt;/code&gt;
 * contains an identifier that is dereferenced. Should the
 * Transforms, the data resulting from dereferencing the &lt;code&gt;URI&lt;/code&gt; is
 * transformed as specified so as to yield the intended cipher value. For
 * example, if the value is base64 encoded within an XML document; the
 * transforms could specify an XPath expression followed by a base64 decoding so
 * as to extract the octets.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The syntax of the &lt;code&gt;URI&lt;/code&gt; and Transforms is similar to that of
 * [XML-DSIG]. However, there is a difference between signature and encryption
 * processing. In [XML-DSIG] both generation and validation processing start
 * with the same source data and perform that transform in the same order. In
 * encryption, the decryptor has only the cipher data and the specified
 * transforms are enumerated for the decryptor, in the order necessary to obtain
 * the octets. Consequently, because it has different semantics Transforms is in
 * the &amp;xenc; namespace.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The schema definition is as follows:
 * &lt;xmp&gt;
 * &lt;element name='CipherReference' type='xenc:CipherReferenceType'/&gt;
 * &lt;complexType name='CipherReferenceType'&gt;
 *     &lt;sequence&gt;
 *         &lt;element name='Transforms' type='xenc:TransformsType' minOccurs='0'/&gt;
 *     &lt;/sequence&gt;
 *     &lt;attribute name='URI' type='anyURI' use='required'/&gt;
 * &lt;/complexType&gt;
 * &lt;/xmp&gt;
