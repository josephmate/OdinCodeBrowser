 * This class is intended to handle &amp;lt;short&amp;gt; element.

 * The result value is created from text of the body of this element.
 * The body parsing is described in the class {@link StringElementHandler}.
 * For example:&lt;pre&gt;
 * &amp;lt;short&amp;gt;200&amp;lt;/short&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 * is shortcut to&lt;pre&gt;

 *     &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;200&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;
 * &amp;lt;/method&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
