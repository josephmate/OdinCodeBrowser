/**
 * The ExecPermission class represents permission for rmid to execute

 * consists of a pathname of a command to launch an activation group.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Pathname is the pathname of the file or directory to grant rmid
 * execute permission.  A pathname that ends in &quot;/*&quot; (where &quot;/&quot; is
 * the file separator character, &lt;code&gt;File.separatorChar&lt;/code&gt;) indicates
 * all the files and directories contained in that directory. A pathname

 * the special token &quot;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;ALL FILES&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&quot; matches &lt;bold&gt;any&lt;/bold&gt; file.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Note: A pathname consisting of a single &quot;*&quot; indicates all the files
