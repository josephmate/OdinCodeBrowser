/**
 * The abstract base class from which the classes &lt;code&gt;Row&lt;/code&gt;
 * The class &lt;code&gt;BaseRow&lt;/code&gt; stores
 * a row's original values as an array of &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;
 * values, which can be retrieved with the method &lt;code&gt;getOrigRow&lt;/code&gt;.
 * This class also provides methods for getting and setting individual
 * values in the row.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * A row's original values are the values it contained before it was last
 * modified.  For example, when the &lt;code&gt;CachedRowSet&lt;/code&gt;method
 * &lt;code&gt;acceptChanges&lt;/code&gt; is called, it will reset a row's original
 * values to be the row's current values.  Then, when the row is modified,
 * the values that were previously the current values will become the row's
 * original values (the values the row had immediately before it was modified).
 * If a row has not been modified, its original values are its initial values.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Subclasses of this class contain more specific details, such as
 * the conditions under which an exception is thrown or the bounds for
 * index parameters.
