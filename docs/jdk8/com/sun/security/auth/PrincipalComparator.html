/**
 * An object that implements the &lt;code&gt;java.security.Principal&lt;/code&gt;
 * interface typically also implements this interface to provide
 * a means for comparing that object to a specified &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt;.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The comparison is achieved via the &lt;code&gt;implies&lt;/code&gt; method.
 * The implementation of the &lt;code&gt;implies&lt;/code&gt; method determines
 * whether this object &quot;implies&quot; the specified &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt;.
 * One example application of this method may be for
 * a &quot;group&quot; object to imply a particular &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt;
 * if that &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; belongs to the group.
 * Another example application of this method would be for
 * &quot;role&quot; object to imply a particular &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt;
 * if that &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; is currently acting in that role.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Although classes that implement this interface typically
 * also implement the &lt;code&gt;java.security.Principal&lt;/code&gt; interface,
 * it is not required.  In other words, classes may implement the
 * &lt;code&gt;java.security.Principal&lt;/code&gt; interface by itself,
 * the &lt;code&gt;PrincipalComparator&lt;/code&gt; interface by itself,
 * or both at the same time.
