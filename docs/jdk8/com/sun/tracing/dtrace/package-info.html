/**
 * This package contains annotations and enumerations that are used to
 * add DTrace-specific information to a tracing provider.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The DTrace-specific annotations modify the attributes of a DTrace provider
 * implementation when it is used by the tracing subsystem.  The annotations are
 * added to a {@code com.sun.tracing} provider specification to control
 * specific attributes of the provider as it relates to DTrace.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Any other tracing subsystems supported by the system will ignore these
 * annotations.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * DTrace probes have additional fields and stability attributes that are
 * not accounted for in the generic tracing package.  If unspecified, the
 * default values are used for the stability and dependency attributes of
 * probes, as well as for the module and field names of the generated probes.
 * The values can be specified by adding the appropriate annotations to the
 * provider specification.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The {@code FunctionName} annotation is used to annotate the tracepoint
 * methods defined in the provider specification.  The value of this annotation
 * is used as the {@code function} field in the generated DTrace probes. It
 * is typically set to the name of the enclosing function where the
 * tracepoint is triggered.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The {@code ModuleName} annotation is used to annotate the provider
 * specification itself and applies to all the probes in the provider.  It
 * sets the value of the {@code module} field in the generated DTrace probes.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The remaining annotations, are also applied to the provider itself, and
 * are used to set the stability and dependency attributes of all probes in
 * that provider.  Each probe field and the probe arguments can be
 * independently assigned interface attributes to control the stability
 * ratings of the probes.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Here is an example of how to declare a provider, specifying additional DTrace
 * data:
&lt;PRE&gt;
    &amp;#064;ProviderName(&quot;my_app_provider&quot;)
    &amp;#064;ModuleName(&quot;app.jar&quot;)
    &amp;#064;ProviderAttributes(&amp;#064;Attributes={
        name=StabilityLevel.STABLE,data=StabilityLevel.STABLE,
        dependency=DependencyClass.COMMON})
    &amp;#064;ProbeAttributes(&amp;#064;Attributes={
        name=StabilityLevel.STABLE,data=StabilityLevel.STABLE,
        dependency=DependencyClass.COMMON})
    &amp;#064;ModuleAttributes(&amp;#064;Attributes={name=StabilityLevel.UNSTABLE})
    public class MyProvider {
        &amp;#064;FunctionName(&quot;main&quot;) void startProbe();
    }
&lt;/PRE&gt;
