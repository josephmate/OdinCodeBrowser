 * Instance of this class is an extension of &lt;code&gt;X509TrustManager&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that this class is referenced by the Deploy workspace. Any updates
 * must make sure that they do not cause any breakage there.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * It takes the responsiblity of checking the peer identity with its
 * principal declared in the cerificate.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The class provides an alternative to &lt;code&gt;HostnameVerifer&lt;/code&gt;.
 * If application customizes its &lt;code&gt;HostnameVerifer&lt;/code&gt; for
 * &lt;code&gt;HttpsURLConnection&lt;/code&gt;, the peer identity will be checked
 * by the customized &lt;code&gt;HostnameVerifer&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, it will
 * be checked by the extended trust manager.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * RFC2830 defines the server identification specification for &quot;LDAP&quot;
 * algorithm. RFC2818 defines both the server identification and the
 * client identification specification for &quot;HTTPS&quot; algorithm.
