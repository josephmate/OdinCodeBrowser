/**
 * This class is for various network permissions.
 * An SSLPermission contains a name (also referred to as a &quot;target name&quot;) but
 * no actions list; you either have the named permission
 * or you don't.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The target name is the name of the network permission (see below). The naming
 * convention follows the  hierarchical property naming convention.
 * Also, an asterisk
 * may appear at the end of the name, following a &quot;.&quot;, or by itself, to
 * signify a wildcard match. For example: &quot;foo.*&quot; and &quot;*&quot; signify a wildcard
 * match, while &quot;*foo&quot; and &quot;a*b&quot; do not.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The following table lists all the possible SSLPermission target names,
 * and for each provides a description of what the permission allows
 * and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 *
 * &lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;Permission Target Name&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;What the Permission Allows&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;Risks of Allowing this Permission&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setHostnameVerifier&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;The ability to set a callback which can decide whether to
 * allow a mismatch between the host being connected to by
 * an HttpsURLConnection and the common name field in
 * server certificate.
 *  &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Malicious
 * code can set a verifier that monitors host names visited by
 * HttpsURLConnection requests or that allows server certificates
 * with invalid common names.
 * &lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;getSSLSessionContext&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;The ability to get the SSLSessionContext of an SSLSession.
 * &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Malicious code may monitor sessions which have been established
 * with SSL peers or might invalidate sessions to slow down performance.
 * &lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
