/**
 * This engine is conformant with the RFC 2571. It is the main object within an SNMP entity (agent, manager...).
 * To an engine is associated an {@link SnmpEngineId}.
 * Engine instantiation is based on a factory {@link com.sun.jmx.snmp.SnmpEngineFactory  SnmpEngineFactory}.
 * When an &lt;CODE&gt; SnmpEngine &lt;/CODE&gt; is created, a User based Security Model (USM) is initialized. The security configuration is located in a text file.
 * The text file is read when the engine is created.
 * &lt;p&gt;Note that the engine is not used when the agent is SNMPv1/SNMPv2 only.
&lt;P&gt; The USM configuration text file is remotely updatable using the USM Mib.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; User that are configured in the Usm text file are nonVolatile. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Usm Mib userEntry supported storage type values are : volatile or nonVolatile only. Other values are rejected and a wrongValue is returned) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; volatile means that user entry is not flushed in security file &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; nonVolatile means that user entry is flushed in security file &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If a nonVolatile row is set to be volatile, it will be not flushed in the file &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a volatile row created from the UsmMib is set to nonVolatile, it will be flushed in the file (if the file exist and is writable otherwise an inconsistentValue is returned)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This API is a Sun Microsystems internal API  and is subject
 * to change without notice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
