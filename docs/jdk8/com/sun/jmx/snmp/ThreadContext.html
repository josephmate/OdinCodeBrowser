/**
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning: The interface of this class is subject to change.
 * Use at your own risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class associates a context with each thread that
 * references it.  The context is a set of mappings between Strings
 * and Objects.  It is managed as a stack, typically with code like
 * this:&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * ThreadContext oldContext = ThreadContext.push(myKey, myObject);
 * // plus possibly further calls to ThreadContext.push...
 * try {
 *      doSomeOperation();
 * } finally {
 *      ThreadContext.restore(oldContext);
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block ensures that
 * the &lt;code&gt;restore&lt;/code&gt; is done even if
 * &lt;code&gt;doSomeOperation&lt;/code&gt; terminates abnormally (with an
 * exception).&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A thread can consult its own context using
 * &lt;code&gt;ThreadContext.get(myKey)&lt;/code&gt;.  The result is the
 * value that was most recently pushed with the given key.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A thread cannot read or modify the context of another thread.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This API is a Sun Microsystems internal API  and is subject
 * to change without notice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

public class ThreadContext implements Cloneable {

    /* The context of a thread is stored as a linked list.  At the
       head of the list is the value returned by localContext.get().
       At the tail of the list is a sentinel ThreadContext value with
       &quot;previous&quot; and &quot;key&quot; both null.  There is a different sentinel
       object for each thread.

       Because a null key indicates the sentinel, we reject attempts to
       push context entries with a null key.

       The reason for using a sentinel rather than just terminating
       the list with a null reference is to protect against incorrect
       or even malicious code.  If you have a reference to the
       sentinel value, you can erase the context stack.  Only the
       caller of the first &quot;push&quot; that put something on the stack can
       get such a reference, so if that caller does not give this
       reference away, no one else can erase the stack.

       If the restore method took a null reference to mean an empty
       stack, anyone could erase the stack, since anyone can make a
       null reference.

       When the stack is empty, we discard the sentinel object and
       have localContext.get() return null.  Then we recreate the
       sentinel object on the first subsequent push.

       ThreadContext objects are immutable.  As a consequence, you can
       give a ThreadContext object to setInitialContext that is no
       longer current.  But the interface says this can be rejected,
       in case we remove immutability later.  */
