/**
 * This interface is implemented by objects that can be executed
 * by a {@link com.sun.jmx.snmp.tasks.TaskServer}.
 * &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; object implements two methods:
 * &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void run(): &lt;/code&gt; from
 *               {@link java.lang.Runnable}&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;ul&gt;This method is called by the {@link com.sun.jmx.snmp.tasks.TaskServer}
 *     when the task is executed.&lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void cancel(): &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;ul&gt;This method is called by the {@link com.sun.jmx.snmp.tasks.TaskServer}
 *     if the &lt;code&gt;TaskServer&lt;/code&gt; is stopped before the
 *     &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; is executed.&lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * An implementation of {@link com.sun.jmx.snmp.tasks.TaskServer} shall call
 * either &lt;code&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cancel()&lt;/code&gt;.
 * Whether the task is executed synchronously in the current
 * thread (when calling &lt;code&gt;TaskServer.submitTask()&lt;/code&gt; or in a new
 * thread dedicated to the task, or in a daemon thread, depends on the
 * implementation of the &lt;code&gt;TaskServer&lt;/code&gt; through which the task
 * is executed.
 * &lt;p&gt;The implementation of &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; must not make any
 * assumption on the implementation of the &lt;code&gt;TaskServer&lt;/code&gt; through
 * which it will be executed.
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This API is a Sun Microsystems internal API  and is subject
 * to change without notice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 * @see com.sun.jmx.snmp.tasks.TaskServer
 *
 * @since 1.5

     * Note that only one of run() or cancel() will be called - and exactly
