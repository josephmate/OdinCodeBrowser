/**
 * Represents a request for notification of an event.  Examples include
 * {@link BreakpointRequest} and {@link ExceptionRequest}.
 * When an event occurs for which an enabled request is present,
 * an  {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet EventSet} will
 * be placed on the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue EventQueue}.
 * The collection of existing event requests is
 * managed by the {@link EventRequestManager}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The number of events generated for an event request can be controlled
 * through filters. Filters provide additional constraints that an event
 * must satisfy before it is placed on the event queue. Multiple filters can
 * be used by making multiple calls to filter addition methods such as
 * {@link ExceptionRequest#addClassFilter(java.lang.String classPattern)}.
 * Filters are added to an event one at a time only while the event is
 * disabled. Multiple filters are applied with CUT-OFF AND, in the order
 * it was added to the request. Only events that satisfy all filters are
 * placed in the event queue.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The set of available filters is dependent on the event request,
 * some examples of filters are:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Thread filters allow control over the thread for which events are
 * generated.
 * &lt;li&gt;Class filters allow control over the class in which the event
 * occurs.
 * &lt;li&gt;Instance filters allow control over the instance in which
 * the event occurs.
 * &lt;li&gt;Count filters allow control over the number of times an event
 * is reported.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * Filters can dramatically improve debugger performance by reducing the
 * amount of event traffic sent from the target VM to the debugger VM.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Any method on &lt;code&gt;EventRequest&lt;/code&gt; which
 * takes &lt;code&gt;EventRequest&lt;/code&gt; as an parameter may throw
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException} if the target VM is
 * disconnected and the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.VMDisconnectEvent} has been or is
 * available to be read from the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Any method on &lt;code&gt;EventRequest&lt;/code&gt; which
 * takes &lt;code&gt;EventRequest&lt;/code&gt; as an parameter may throw
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.VMOutOfMemoryException} if the target VM has run out of memory.
