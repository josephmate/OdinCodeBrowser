/**
 * The type of an object in a target VM. ReferenceType encompasses
 * classes, interfaces, and array types as defined in
 * &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;.
 * All ReferenceType objects belong to one of the following
 * subinterfaces:
 * {@link ClassType} for classes,
 * {@link InterfaceType} for interfaces, and
 * {@link ArrayType} for arrays.
 * Note that primitive classes (for example, the
 * {@link ClassObjectReference#reflectedType() reflected type} of
 * {@link java.lang.Integer#TYPE Integer.TYPE})
 * are represented as ClassType.
 * The VM creates Class objects for all three, so from the VM perspective,
 * each ReferenceType maps to a distinct Class object.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * ReferenceTypes can
 * be obtained by querying a particular {@link ObjectReference} for its
 * type or by getting a list of all reference types from the
 * {@link VirtualMachine}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * ReferenceType provides access to static type information such as
 * methods and fields and provides access to dynamic type
 * information such as the corresponding Class object and the classloader.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Any method on &lt;code&gt;ReferenceType&lt;/code&gt; which directly or
 * indirectly takes &lt;code&gt;ReferenceType&lt;/code&gt; as an parameter may throw
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException} if the target VM is
 * disconnected and the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.VMDisconnectEvent} has been or is
 * available to be read from the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Any method on &lt;code&gt;ReferenceType&lt;/code&gt; which directly or
 * indirectly takes &lt;code&gt;ReferenceType&lt;/code&gt; as an parameter may throw
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.VMOutOfMemoryException} if the target VM has run out of memory.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Any method on &lt;code&gt;ReferenceType&lt;/code&gt; or which directly or indirectly takes
 * &lt;code&gt;ReferenceType&lt;/code&gt; as parameter may throw
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.ObjectCollectedException} if the mirrored type has been unloaded.
