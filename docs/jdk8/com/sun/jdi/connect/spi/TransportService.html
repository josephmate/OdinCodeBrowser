/**
 * A transport service for connections between a debugger and
 * a target VM.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A transport service is a concrete subclass of this class
 * that has a zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract
 * methods specified below. It is the underlying service
 * used by a {@link com.sun.jdi.connect.Transport} for
 * connections between a debugger and a target VM.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A transport service is used to establish a connection
 * between a debugger and a target VM, and to transport Java
 * Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets over an underlying
 * communication protocol. In essence a transport service
 * implementation binds JDWP (as specified in the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../../../../../technotes/guides/jpda/jdwp-spec.html&quot;&gt;
 * JDWP specification&lt;/a&gt;) to an underlying communication
 * protocol. A transport service implementation provides
 * a reliable JDWP packet transportation service. JDWP
 * packets are sent to and from the target VM without duplication
 * or data loss. A transport service implementation may be
 * based on an underlying communication protocol that is
 * reliable or unreliable. If the underlying communication
 * protocol is reliable then the transport service implementation
 * may be relatively simple and may only need to transport JDWP
 * packets as payloads of the underlying communication
 * protocol. In the case of an unreliable communication
 * protocol the transport service implementation may include
 * additional protocol support in order to ensure that packets
 * are not duplicated and that there is no data loss. The
 * details of such protocols are specific to the implementation
 * but may involve techniques such as the &lt;i&gt;positive
 * acknowledgment with retransmission&lt;/i&gt; technique used in
 * protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
 * (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0793.txt&quot;&gt; RFC 793
 * &lt;/a&gt;).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A transport service can be used to initiate a connection
 * to a target VM. This is done by invoking the {@link #attach}
 * method. Alternatively, a transport service can listen and
 * accept connections initiated by a target VM. This is done
 * by invoking the {@link #startListening(String)} method to
 * put the transport into listen mode. Then the {@link #accept}
 * method is used to accept a connection initiated by a
 * target VM.
