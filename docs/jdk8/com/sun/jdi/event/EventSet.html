/**
 * Several {@link Event} objects may be created at a given time by
 * the target {@link VirtualMachine}. For example, there may be
 * more than one {@link com.sun.jdi.request.BreakpointRequest}
 * for a given {@link Location}
 * or you might single step to the same location as a
 * BreakpointRequest.  These {@link Event} objects are delivered
 * together as an EventSet.  For uniformity, an EventSet is always used
 * to deliver {@link Event} objects.  EventSets are delivered by
 * the {@link EventQueue}.
 * EventSets are unmodifiable.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Associated with the issuance of an event set, suspensions may
 * have occurred in the target VM.  These suspensions correspond
 * with the {@link #suspendPolicy() suspend policy}.
 * To assure matching resumes occur, it is recommended,
 * where possible,
 * to complete the processing of an event set with
 * {@link #resume() EventSet.resume()}.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The events that are grouped in an EventSet are restricted in the
 * following ways:

 *     &lt;/UL&gt;

 *     &lt;LI&gt;{@link ClassUnloadEvent}
 *     &lt;/UL&gt;

 *     &lt;UL&gt;
 *     &lt;LI&gt;{@link AccessWatchpointEvent}
 *     &lt;/UL&gt;

 *     &lt;UL&gt;
 *     &lt;LI&gt;{@link ModificationWatchpointEvent}
