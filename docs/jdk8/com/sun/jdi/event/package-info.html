/**
 * This package defines JDI events and event processing.
 * An {@link com.sun.jdi.event.Event} is always a member of an
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet}, which
 * is retrieved from the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue}.
 * Examples of Events include
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.event.BreakpointEvent &quot;breakpoints events&quot;},
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.event.ThreadStartEvent &quot;thread creation events&quot;} and
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.event.VMDeathEvent &quot;virtual machine death event&quot;}.
 *  With the exception
 * of termination events, all events received must be requested with an
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequest &quot;EventRequest&quot;}.  The
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.request} package defines event requests and event
 * request management.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Methods may be added to the interfaces in the JDI packages in future
 * releases. Existing packages may be renamed if the JDI becomes a standard
 * extension.
