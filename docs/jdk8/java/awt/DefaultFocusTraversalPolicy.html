/**
 * A FocusTraversalPolicy that determines traversal order based on the order
 * of child Components in a Container. From a particular focus cycle root, the
 * policy makes a pre-order traversal of the Component hierarchy, and traverses
 * a Container's children according to the ordering of the array returned by
 * &lt;code&gt;Container.getComponents()&lt;/code&gt;. Portions of the hierarchy that are
 * not visible and displayable will not be searched.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If client code has explicitly set the focusability of a Component by either
 * overriding &lt;code&gt;Component.isFocusTraversable()&lt;/code&gt; or
 * &lt;code&gt;Component.isFocusable()&lt;/code&gt;, or by calling
 * &lt;code&gt;Component.setFocusable()&lt;/code&gt;, then a DefaultFocusTraversalPolicy
 * behaves exactly like a ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy. If, however, the
 * Component is relying on default focusability, then a
 * DefaultFocusTraversalPolicy will reject all Components with non-focusable
 * peers. This is the default FocusTraversalPolicy for all AWT Containers.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The focusability of a peer is implementation-dependent. Sun recommends that
 * all implementations for a particular native platform construct peers with
 * the same focusability. The recommendations for Windows and Unix are that
 * Canvases, Labels, Panels, Scrollbars, ScrollPanes, Windows, and lightweight
 * Components have non-focusable peers, and all other Components have focusable
 * peers. These recommendations are used in the Sun AWT implementations. Note
 * that the focusability of a Component's peer is different from, and does not
 * impact, the focusability of the Component itself.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Please see
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/focus.html&quot;&gt;
 * How to Use the Focus Subsystem&lt;/a&gt;,
 * a section in &lt;em&gt;The Java Tutorial&lt;/em&gt;, and the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;../../java/awt/doc-files/FocusSpec.html&quot;&gt;Focus Specification&lt;/a&gt;
 * for more information.
