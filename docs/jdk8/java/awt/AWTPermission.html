/**
 * This class is for AWT permissions.
 * An &lt;code&gt;AWTPermission&lt;/code&gt; contains a target name but
 * no actions list; you either have the named permission
 * or you don't.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The target name is the name of the AWT permission (see below). The naming
 * convention follows the hierarchical property naming convention.
 * Also, an asterisk could be used to represent all AWT permissions.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The following table lists all the possible &lt;code&gt;AWTPermission&lt;/code&gt;
 * target names, and for each provides a description of what the
 * permission allows and a discussion of the risks of granting code
 * the permission.
 *
 * &lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary=&quot;AWTPermission target names, descriptions, and associated risks.&quot;&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;Permission Target Name&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;What the Permission Allows&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;Risks of Allowing this Permission&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;accessClipboard&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Posting and retrieval of information to and from the AWT clipboard&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow malfeasant code to share
 * potentially sensitive or confidential information.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;accessEventQueue&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Access to the AWT event queue&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;After retrieving the AWT event queue,
 * malicious code may peek at and even remove existing events
 * from its event queue, as well as post bogus events which may purposefully
 * cause the application or applet to misbehave in an insecure manner.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;accessSystemTray&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Access to the AWT SystemTray instance&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow malicious code to add tray icons to the system tray.
 * First, such an icon may look like the icon of some known application
 * (such as a firewall or anti-virus) and order a user to do something unsafe
 * (with help of balloon messages). Second, the system tray may be glutted with
 * tray icons so that no one could add a tray icon anymore.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;createRobot&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Create java.awt.Robot objects&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;The java.awt.Robot object allows code to generate native-level
 * mouse and keyboard events as well as read the screen. It could allow
 * malicious code to control the system, run other programs, read the
 * display, and deny mouse and keyboard access to the user.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;fullScreenExclusive&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Enter full-screen exclusive mode&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Entering full-screen exclusive mode allows direct access to
 * low-level graphics card memory.  This could be used to spoof the
 * system, since the program is in direct control of rendering. Depending on
 * the implementation, the security warning may not be shown for the windows
 * used to enter the full-screen exclusive mode (assuming that the {@code
 * fullScreenExclusive} permission has been granted to this application). Note
 * that this behavior does not mean that the {@code
 * showWindowWithoutWarningBanner} permission will be automatically granted to
 * the application which has the {@code fullScreenExclusive} permission:
 * non-full-screen windows will continue to be shown with the security
 * warning.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;listenToAllAWTEvents&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Listen to all AWT events, system-wide&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;After adding an AWT event listener,
 * malicious code may scan all AWT events dispatched in the system,
 * allowing it to read all user input (such as passwords).  Each
 * AWT event listener is called from within the context of that
 * event queue's EventDispatchThread, so if the accessEventQueue
 * permission is also enabled, malicious code could modify the
 * contents of AWT event queues system-wide, causing the application
 * or applet to misbehave in an insecure manner.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;readDisplayPixels&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Readback of pixels from the display screen&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Interfaces such as the java.awt.Composite interface or the
 * java.awt.Robot class allow arbitrary code to examine pixels on the
 * display enable malicious code to snoop on the activities of the user.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;replaceKeyboardFocusManager&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Sets the &lt;code&gt;KeyboardFocusManager&lt;/code&gt; for
 *       a particular thread.
 *   &lt;td&gt;When &lt;code&gt;SecurityManager&lt;/code&gt; is installed, the invoking
 *       thread must be granted this permission in order to replace
 *       the current &lt;code&gt;KeyboardFocusManager&lt;/code&gt;.  If permission
 *       is not granted, a &lt;code&gt;SecurityException&lt;/code&gt; will be thrown.
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setAppletStub&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting the stub which implements Applet container services&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Malicious code could set an applet's stub and result in unexpected
 * behavior or denial of service to an applet.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setWindowAlwaysOnTop&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting always-on-top property of the window: {@link Window#setAlwaysOnTop}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;The malicious window might make itself look and behave like a real full desktop, so that
 * information entered by the unsuspecting user is captured and subsequently misused &lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;showWindowWithoutWarningBanner&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Display of a window without also displaying a banner warning
 * that the window was created by an applet&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Without this warning,
 * an applet may pop up windows without the user knowing that they
 * belong to an applet.  Since users may make security-sensitive
 * decisions based on whether or not the window belongs to an applet
 * (entering a username and password into a dialog box, for example),
 * disabling this warning banner may allow applets to trick the user
 * into entering such information.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;toolkitModality&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Creating {@link Dialog.ModalityType#TOOLKIT_MODAL TOOLKIT_MODAL} dialogs
 *       and setting the {@link Dialog.ModalExclusionType#TOOLKIT_EXCLUDE
 *       TOOLKIT_EXCLUDE} window property.&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;When a toolkit-modal dialog is shown from an applet, it blocks all other
 * applets in the browser. When launching applications from Java Web Start,
 * its windows (such as the security dialog) may also be blocked by toolkit-modal
 * dialogs, shown from these applications.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;watchMousePointer&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Getting the information about the mouse pointer position at any
 * time&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Constantly watching the mouse pointer,
 * an applet can make guesses about what the user is doing, i.e. moving
 * the mouse to the lower left corner of the screen most likely means that
 * the user is about to launch an application. If a virtual keypad is used
 * so that keyboard is emulated using the mouse, an applet may guess what
 * is being typed.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
