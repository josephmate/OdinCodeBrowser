/**
 * &lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; The &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; class is obsolete and is
 * available only for backwards compatibility.  It has been replaced
 * by the &lt;code&gt;AWTEvent&lt;/code&gt; class and its subclasses.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; is a platform-independent class that
 * encapsulates events from the platform's Graphical User
 * Interface in the Java&amp;nbsp;1.0 event model. In Java&amp;nbsp;1.1
 * and later versions, the &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; class is maintained
 * only for backwards compatibility. The information in this
 * class description is provided to assist programmers in
 * converting Java&amp;nbsp;1.0 programs to the new event model.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In the Java&amp;nbsp;1.0 event model, an event contains an
 * {@link Event#id} field
 * that indicates what type of event it is and which other
 * &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; variables are relevant for the event.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For keyboard events, {@link Event#key}
 * contains a value indicating which key was activated, and
 * {@link Event#modifiers} contains the
 * modifiers for that event.  For the KEY_PRESS and KEY_RELEASE
 * event ids, the value of &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; is the unicode
 * character code for the key. For KEY_ACTION and
 * KEY_ACTION_RELEASE, the value of &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; is
 * one of the defined action-key identifiers in the
 * &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; class (&lt;code&gt;PGUP&lt;/code&gt;,
 * &lt;code&gt;PGDN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;F1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;F2&lt;/code&gt;, etc).
