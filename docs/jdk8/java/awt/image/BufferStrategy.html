/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;BufferStrategy&lt;/code&gt; class represents the mechanism with which
 * to organize complex memory on a particular &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; or
 * &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;.  Hardware and software limitations determine whether and
 * how a particular buffer strategy can be implemented.  These limitations
 * are detectable through the capabilities of the
 * &lt;code&gt;GraphicsConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; used when creating the
 * &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * It is worth noting that the terms &lt;i&gt;buffer&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;surface&lt;/i&gt; are meant
 * to be synonymous: an area of contiguous memory, either in video device
 * memory or in system memory.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are several types of complex buffer strategies, including
 * sequential ring buffering and blit buffering.
 * Sequential ring buffering (i.e., double or triple
 * buffering) is the most common; an application draws to a single &lt;i&gt;back
 * buffer&lt;/i&gt; and then moves the contents to the front (display) in a single
 * step, either by copying the data or moving the video pointer.
 * Moving the video pointer exchanges the buffers so that the first buffer
 * drawn becomes the &lt;i&gt;front buffer&lt;/i&gt;, or what is currently displayed on the
 * device; this is called &lt;i&gt;page flipping&lt;/i&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Alternatively, the contents of the back buffer can be copied, or
 * &lt;i&gt;blitted&lt;/i&gt; forward in a chain instead of moving the video pointer.
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * Double buffering:
 *
 *                    ***********         ***********
 *                    *         * ------&gt; *         *
 * [To display] &lt;---- * Front B *   Show  * Back B. * &lt;---- Rendering
 *                    *         * &lt;------ *         *
 *                    ***********         ***********
 *
 * Triple buffering:
 *
 * [To      ***********         ***********        ***********
 * display] *         * --------+---------+------&gt; *         *
 *    &lt;---- * Front B *   Show  * Mid. B. *        * Back B. * &lt;---- Rendering
 *          *         * &lt;------ *         * &lt;----- *         *
 *          ***********         ***********        ***********
 *
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Here is an example of how buffer strategies can be created and used:
 * &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
 *
 * // Check the capabilities of the GraphicsConfiguration
 * ...
 *
 * // Create our component
 * Window w = new Window(gc);
 *
 * // Show our window
 * w.setVisible(true);
 *
 * // Create a general double-buffering strategy
 * w.createBufferStrategy(2);
 * BufferStrategy strategy = w.getBufferStrategy();
 *
 * // Main loop
 * while (!done) {
 *     // Prepare for rendering the next frame
 *     // ...
 *
 *     // Render single frame
 *     do {
 *         // The following loop ensures that the contents of the drawing buffer
 *         // are consistent in case the underlying surface was recreated
 *         do {
 *             // Get a new graphics context every time through the loop
 *             // to make sure the strategy is validated
 *             Graphics graphics = strategy.getDrawGraphics();
 *
 *             // Render to graphics
 *             // ...
 *
 *             // Dispose the graphics
 *             graphics.dispose();
 *
 *             // Repeat the rendering if the drawing buffer contents
 *             // were restored
 *         } while (strategy.contentsRestored());
 *
 *         // Display the buffer
 *         strategy.show();
 *
 *         // Repeat the rendering if the drawing buffer was lost
 *     } while (strategy.contentsLost());
 * }
 *
 * // Dispose the window
 * w.setVisible(false);
 * w.dispose();
 * &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
