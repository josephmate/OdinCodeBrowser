/**
 * A low-level event which indicates that a container's contents
 * changed because a component was added or removed.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Container events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
 * The AWT will automatically handle changes to the containers
 * contents internally so that the program works properly regardless of
 * whether the program is receiving these events or not.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * This low-level event is generated by a container object (such as a
 * Panel) when a component is added to it or removed from it.
 * The event is passed to every &lt;code&gt;ContainerListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * or &lt;code&gt;ContainerAdapter&lt;/code&gt; object which registered to receive such
 * events using the component's &lt;code&gt;addContainerListener&lt;/code&gt; method.
 * (&lt;code&gt;ContainerAdapter&lt;/code&gt; objects implement the
 * &lt;code&gt;ContainerListener&lt;/code&gt; interface.) Each such listener object
 * gets this &lt;code&gt;ContainerEvent&lt;/code&gt; when the event occurs.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
 * of any particular {@code ContainerEvent} instance is not
 * in the range from {@code CONTAINER_FIRST} to {@code CONTAINER_LAST}.
