/**
 * The listener interface for receiving &quot;interesting&quot; mouse events
 * (press, release, click, enter, and exit) on a component.
 * (To track mouse moves and mouse drags, use the
 * &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt;.)
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The class that is interested in processing a mouse event
 * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 * contains) or extends the abstract &lt;code&gt;MouseAdapter&lt;/code&gt; class
 * (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's &lt;code&gt;addMouseListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * method. A mouse event is generated when the mouse is pressed, released
 * clicked (pressed and released). A mouse event is also generated when
 * the mouse cursor enters or leaves a component. When a mouse event
 * occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and
 * the &lt;code&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
