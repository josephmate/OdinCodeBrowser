/**
 * A semantic event which indicates that an object's text changed.
 * This high-level event is generated by an object (such as a TextComponent)
 * when its text changes. The event is passed to
 * every &lt;code&gt;TextListener&lt;/code&gt; object which registered to receive such
 * events using the component's &lt;code&gt;addTextListener&lt;/code&gt; method.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The object that implements the &lt;code&gt;TextListener&lt;/code&gt; interface gets
 * this &lt;code&gt;TextEvent&lt;/code&gt; when the event occurs. The listener is
 * spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and key strokes
 * Instead, it can process a &quot;meaningful&quot; (semantic) event like &quot;text changed&quot;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
 * of any particular {@code TextEvent} instance is not
 * in the range from {@code TEXT_FIRST} to {@code TEXT_LAST}.
