/**
 * The listener interface for receiving &lt;code&gt;WindowEvents&lt;/code&gt;, including
 * &lt;code&gt;WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS&lt;/code&gt; events.
 * The class that is interested in processing a &lt;code&gt;WindowEvent&lt;/code&gt;
 * either implements this interface (and
 * all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract
 * &lt;code&gt;WindowAdapter&lt;/code&gt; class (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;
 * using the &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;addWindowFocusListener&lt;/code&gt; method.
 * When the &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;'s
 * status changes by virtue of it being opened, closed, activated, deactivated,
 * iconified, or deiconified, or by focus being transfered into or out of the
 * &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,
 * and the &lt;code&gt;WindowEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
