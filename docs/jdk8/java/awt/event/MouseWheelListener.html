/**
 * The listener interface for receiving mouse wheel events on a component.
 * (For clicks and other mouse events, use the &lt;code&gt;MouseListener&lt;/code&gt;.
 * For mouse movement and drags, use the &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt;.)
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The class that is interested in processing a mouse wheel event
 * implements this interface (and all the methods it contains).
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's &lt;code&gt;addMouseWheelListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * method. A mouse wheel event is generated when the mouse wheel is rotated.
 * When a mouse wheel event occurs, that object's &lt;code&gt;mouseWheelMoved&lt;/code&gt;
 * method is invoked.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see
 * the class description for {@link MouseWheelEvent}.
