/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving component events.
 * The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
 * convenience for creating listener objects.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Extend this class to create a &lt;code&gt;ComponentEvent&lt;/code&gt; listener
 * and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
 * &lt;code&gt;ComponentListener&lt;/code&gt; interface, you have to define all of
 * the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 * all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Create a listener object using your class and then register it with a
 * component using the component's &lt;code&gt;addComponentListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * method. When the component's size, location, or visibility
 * changes, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,
 * and the &lt;code&gt;ComponentEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
