/**
 * The listener interface for receiving component events.
 * The class that is interested in processing a component event
 * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 * contains) or extends the abstract &lt;code&gt;ComponentAdapter&lt;/code&gt; class
 * (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's &lt;code&gt;addComponentListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * method. When the component's size, location, or visibility
 * changes, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,
 * and the &lt;code&gt;ComponentEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Component events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
 * The AWT will automatically handle component moves and resizes
 * internally so that GUI layout works properly regardless of
 * whether a program registers a &lt;code&gt;ComponentListener&lt;/code&gt; or not.
