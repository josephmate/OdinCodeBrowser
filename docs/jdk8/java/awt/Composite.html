/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Composite&lt;/code&gt; interface, along with
 * {@link CompositeContext}, defines the methods to compose a draw
 * primitive with the underlying graphics area.
 * After the &lt;code&gt;Composite&lt;/code&gt; is set in the
 * {@link Graphics2D} context, it combines a shape, text, or an image
 * being rendered with the colors that have already been rendered
 * according to pre-defined rules. The classes
 * implementing this interface provide the rules and a method to create
 * the context for a particular operation.
 * &lt;code&gt;CompositeContext&lt;/code&gt; is an environment used by the
 * compositing operation, which is created by the &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt;
 * prior to the start of the operation.  &lt;code&gt;CompositeContext&lt;/code&gt;
 * contains private information and resources needed for a compositing
 * operation.  When the &lt;code&gt;CompositeContext&lt;/code&gt; is no longer needed,
 * the &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt; object disposes of it in order to reclaim
 * resources allocated for the operation.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Instances of classes implementing &lt;code&gt;Composite&lt;/code&gt; must be
 * immutable because the &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt; does not clone
 * these objects when they are set as an attribute with the
 * &lt;code&gt;setComposite&lt;/code&gt; method or when the &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt;
 * object is cloned.  This is to avoid undefined rendering behavior of
 * &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt;, resulting from the modification of
 * the &lt;code&gt;Composite&lt;/code&gt; object after it has been set in the
 * &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt; context.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Since this interface must expose the contents of pixels on the
 * target device or image to potentially arbitrary code, the use of
 * custom objects which implement this interface when rendering directly
 * to a screen device is governed by the &lt;code&gt;readDisplayPixels&lt;/code&gt;
 * {@link AWTPermission}.  The permission check will occur when such
 * a custom object is passed to the &lt;code&gt;setComposite&lt;/code&gt; method
 * of a &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt; retrieved from a {@link Component}.
 * @see AlphaComposite
 * @see CompositeContext
