/**
  * The ComponentOrientation class encapsulates the language-sensitive
  * orientation that is to be used to order the elements of a component
  * or of text. It is used to reflect the differences in this ordering
  * between Western alphabets, Middle Eastern (such as Hebrew), and Far
  * Eastern (such as Japanese).
  * &lt;p&gt;
  * Fundamentally, this governs items (such as characters) which are laid out
  * in lines, with the lines then laid out in a block. This also applies
  * to items in a widget: for example, in a check box where the box is
  * positioned relative to the text.
  * &lt;p&gt;
  * There are four different orientations used in modern languages
  * as in the following table.&lt;br&gt;
  * &lt;pre&gt;
  * LT          RT          TL          TR
  * A B C       C B A       A D G       G D A
  * D E F       F E D       B E H       H E B
  * G H I       I H G       C F I       I F C
  * &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  * (In the header, the two-letter abbreviation represents the item direction
  * in the first letter, and the line direction in the second. For example,
  * LT means &quot;items left-to-right, lines top-to-bottom&quot;,
  * TL means &quot;items top-to-bottom, lines left-to-right&quot;, and so on.)
  * &lt;p&gt;
  * The orientations are:
  * &lt;ul&gt;
  * &lt;li&gt;LT - Western Europe (optional for Japanese, Chinese, Korean)
  * &lt;li&gt;RT - Middle East (Arabic, Hebrew)
  * &lt;li&gt;TR - Japanese, Chinese, Korean
  * &lt;li&gt;TL - Mongolian
  * &lt;/ul&gt;
  * Components whose view and controller code depends on orientation
  * should use the &lt;code&gt;isLeftToRight()&lt;/code&gt; and
  * &lt;code&gt;isHorizontal()&lt;/code&gt; methods to
  * determine their behavior. They should not include switch-like
  * code that keys off of the constants, such as:
  * &lt;pre&gt;
  * if (orientation == LEFT_TO_RIGHT) {
  *   ...
  * } else if (orientation == RIGHT_TO_LEFT) {
  *   ...
  * } else {
  *   // Oops
  * }
  * &lt;/pre&gt;
  * This is unsafe, since more constants may be added in the future and
  * since it is not guaranteed that orientation objects will be unique.
