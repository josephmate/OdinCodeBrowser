/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Printable&lt;/code&gt; interface is implemented
 * by the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; methods of the current
 * page painter, which is called by the printing
 * system to render a page.  When building a
 * {@link Pageable}, pairs of {@link PageFormat}
 * instances and instances that implement
 * this interface are used to describe each page. The
 * instance implementing &lt;code&gt;Printable&lt;/code&gt; is called to
 * print the page's graphics.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A &lt;code&gt;Printable(..)&lt;/code&gt; may be set on a &lt;code&gt;PrinterJob&lt;/code&gt;.
 * When the client subsequently initiates printing by calling
 * &lt;code&gt;PrinterJob.print(..)&lt;/code&gt; control
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * is handed to the printing system until all pages have been printed.
 * It does this by calling &lt;code&gt;Printable.print(..)&lt;/code&gt; until
 * all pages in the document have been printed.
 * In using the &lt;code&gt;Printable&lt;/code&gt; interface the printing
 * commits to image the contents of a page whenever
 * requested by the printing system.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The parameters to &lt;code&gt;Printable.print(..)&lt;/code&gt; include a
 * &lt;code&gt;PageFormat&lt;/code&gt; which describes the printable area of
 * the page, needed for calculating the contents that will fit the
 * page, and the page index, which specifies the zero-based print
 * stream index of the requested page.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For correct printing behaviour, the following points should be
 * observed:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt; The printing system may request a page index more than once.
 * On each occasion equal PageFormat parameters will be supplied.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;The printing system will call &lt;code&gt;Printable.print(..)&lt;/code&gt;
 * with page indexes which increase monotonically, although as noted above,
 * the &lt;code&gt;Printable&lt;/code&gt; should expect multiple calls for a page index
 * and that page indexes may be skipped, when page ranges are specified
 * by the client, or by a user through a print dialog.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;If multiple collated copies of a document are requested, and the
 * printer cannot natively support this, then the document may be imaged
 * multiple times. Printing will start each copy from the lowest print
 * stream page index page.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;With the exception of re-imaging an entire document for multiple
 * collated copies, the increasing page index order means that when
 * page N is requested if a client needs to calculate page break position,
 * it may safely discard any state related to pages &amp;lt; N, and make current
 * that for page N. &quot;State&quot; usually is just the calculated position in the
 * document that corresponds to the start of the page.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;When called by the printing system the &lt;code&gt;Printable&lt;/code&gt; must
 * inspect and honour the supplied PageFormat parameter as well as the
 * page index.  The format of the page to be drawn is specified by the
 * supplied PageFormat. The size, orientation and imageable area of the page
 * is therefore already determined and rendering must be within this
 * imageable area.
 * This is key to correct printing behaviour, and it has the
 * implication that the client has the responsibility of tracking
 * what content belongs on the specified page.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;Printable&lt;/code&gt; is obtained from a client-supplied
 * &lt;code&gt;Pageable&lt;/code&gt; then the client may provide different PageFormats
 * for each page index. Calculations of page breaks must account for this.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
