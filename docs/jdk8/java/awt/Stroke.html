/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Stroke&lt;/code&gt; interface allows a
 * {@link Graphics2D} object to obtain a {@link Shape} that is the
 * decorated outline, or stylistic representation of the outline,
 * of the specified &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt;.
 * Stroking a &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; is like tracing its outline with a
 * marking pen of the appropriate size and shape.
 * The area where the pen would place ink is the area enclosed by the
 * outline &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The methods of the &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt; interface that use the
 * outline &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; returned by a &lt;code&gt;Stroke&lt;/code&gt; object
 * include &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; and any other methods that are
 * implemented in terms of that method, such as
 * &lt;code&gt;drawLine&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;drawRect&lt;/code&gt;,
 * &lt;code&gt;drawRoundRect&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;drawOval&lt;/code&gt;,
 * &lt;code&gt;drawArc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;drawPolyline&lt;/code&gt;,
 * and &lt;code&gt;drawPolygon&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The objects of the classes implementing &lt;code&gt;Stroke&lt;/code&gt;
 * must be read-only because &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt; does not
 * clone these objects either when they are set as an attribute
 * with the &lt;code&gt;setStroke&lt;/code&gt; method or when the
 * &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt; object is itself cloned.
 * If a &lt;code&gt;Stroke&lt;/code&gt; object is modified after it is set in
 * the &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt; context then the behavior
 * of subsequent rendering would be undefined.
