/**
 * During DnD operations it is possible that a user may wish to drop the
 * subject of the operation on a region of a scrollable GUI control that is
 * not currently visible to the user.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In such situations it is desirable that the GUI control detect this
 * and institute a scroll operation in order to make obscured region(s)
 * visible to the user. This feature is known as autoscrolling.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If a GUI control is both an active &lt;code&gt;DropTarget&lt;/code&gt;
 * and is also scrollable, it
 * can receive notifications of autoscrolling gestures by the user from
 * the DnD system by implementing this interface.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An autoscrolling gesture is initiated by the user by keeping the drag
 * cursor motionless with a border region of the &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt;,
 * referred to as
 * the &quot;autoscrolling region&quot;, for a predefined period of time, this will
 * result in repeated scroll requests to the &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt;
 * until the drag &lt;code&gt;Cursor&lt;/code&gt; resumes its motion.
