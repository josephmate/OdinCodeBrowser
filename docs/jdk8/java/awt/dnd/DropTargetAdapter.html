/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving drop target events. The methods in
 * this class are empty. This class exists only as a convenience for creating
 * listener objects.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Extend this class to create a &lt;code&gt;DropTargetEvent&lt;/code&gt; listener
 * and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
 * &lt;code&gt;DropTargetListener&lt;/code&gt; interface, you have to define all of
 * the methods in it. This abstract class defines a null implementation for
 * every method except &lt;code&gt;drop(DropTargetDropEvent)&lt;/code&gt;, so you only have
 * to define methods for events you care about.) You must provide an
 * implementation for at least &lt;code&gt;drop(DropTargetDropEvent)&lt;/code&gt;. This
 * method cannot have a null implementation because its specification requires
 * that you either accept or reject the drop, and, if accepted, indicate
 * whether the drop was successful.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 * a &lt;code&gt;DropTarget&lt;/code&gt;. When the drag enters, moves over, or exits
 * the operable part of the drop site for that &lt;code&gt;DropTarget&lt;/code&gt;, when
 * the drop action changes, and when the drop occurs, the relevant method in
 * the listener object is invoked, and the &lt;code&gt;DropTargetEvent&lt;/code&gt; is
 * passed to it.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The operable part of the drop site for the &lt;code&gt;DropTarget&lt;/code&gt; is
 * the part of the associated &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt;'s geometry that is not
 * obscured by an overlapping top-level window or by another
 * &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt; higher in the Z-order that has an associated active
 * &lt;code&gt;DropTarget&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * During the drag, the data associated with the current drag operation can be
 * retrieved by calling &lt;code&gt;getTransferable()&lt;/code&gt; on
 * &lt;code&gt;DropTargetDragEvent&lt;/code&gt; instances passed to the listener's
 * methods.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that &lt;code&gt;getTransferable()&lt;/code&gt; on the
 * &lt;code&gt;DropTargetDragEvent&lt;/code&gt; instance should only be called within the
 * respective listener's method and all the necessary data should be retrieved
 * from the returned &lt;code&gt;Transferable&lt;/code&gt; before that method returns.
