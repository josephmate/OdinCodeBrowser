/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving drag source events. The methods in
 * this class are empty. This class exists only as a convenience for creating
 * listener objects.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Extend this class to create a &lt;code&gt;DragSourceEvent&lt;/code&gt; listener
 * and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
 * &lt;code&gt;DragSourceListener&lt;/code&gt; interface, you have to define all of
 * the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 * all, so you only have to define methods for events you care about.)
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 * a &lt;code&gt;DragSource&lt;/code&gt;. When the drag enters, moves over, or exits
 * a drop site, when the drop action changes, and when the drag ends, the
 * relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the
 * &lt;code&gt;DragSourceEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The drop site is &lt;i&gt;associated with the previous &lt;code&gt;dragEnter()&lt;/code&gt;
 * invocation&lt;/i&gt; if the latest invocation of &lt;code&gt;dragEnter()&lt;/code&gt; on this
 * adapter corresponds to that drop site and is not followed by a
 * &lt;code&gt;dragExit()&lt;/code&gt; invocation on this adapter.
