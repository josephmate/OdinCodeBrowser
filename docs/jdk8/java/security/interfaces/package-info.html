/**
 * Provides interfaces for generating RSA (Rivest, Shamir and
 * Adleman AsymmetricCipher algorithm)
 * keys as defined in the RSA Laboratory Technical Note
 * PKCS#1, and DSA (Digital Signature
 * Algorithm) keys as defined in NIST's FIPS-186.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Note that these interfaces are intended only for key
 * implementations whose key material is accessible and
 * available. These interfaces are not intended for key
 * implementations whose key material resides in
 * inaccessible, protected storage (such as in a
 * hardware device).
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * For more developer information on how to use these
 * interfaces, including information on how to design
 * {@code Key} classes for hardware devices, please refer
 * to these cryptographic provider developer guides:
