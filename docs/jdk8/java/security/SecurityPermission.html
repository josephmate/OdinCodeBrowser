/**
 * This class is for security permissions.
 * A SecurityPermission contains a name (also referred to as a &quot;target name&quot;)
 * but no actions list; you either have the named permission
 * or you don't.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The target name is the name of a security configuration parameter (see below).
 * Currently the SecurityPermission object is used to guard access
 * to the Policy, Security, Provider, Signer, and Identity
 * objects.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The following table lists all the possible SecurityPermission target names,
 * and for each provides a description of what the permission allows
 * and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.
 *
 * &lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary=&quot;target name,what the permission allows, and associated risks&quot;&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;Permission Target Name&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;What the Permission Allows&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;Risks of Allowing this Permission&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;createAccessControlContext&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Creation of an AccessControlContext&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This allows someone to instantiate an AccessControlContext
 * with a {@code DomainCombiner}.  Extreme care must be taken when
 * granting this permission. Malicious code could create a DomainCombiner
 * that augments the set of permissions granted to code, and even grant the
 * code {@link java.security.AllPermission}.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;getDomainCombiner&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of an AccessControlContext's DomainCombiner&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This allows someone to retrieve an AccessControlContext's
 * {@code DomainCombiner}.  Since DomainCombiners may contain
 * sensitive information, this could potentially lead to a privacy leak.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;getPolicy&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of the system-wide security policy (specifically, of the
 * currently-installed Policy object)&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This allows someone to query the policy via the
 * {@code getPermissions} call,
 * which discloses which permissions would be granted to a given CodeSource.
 * While revealing the policy does not compromise the security of
 * the system, it does provide malicious code with additional information
 * which it may use to better aim an attack. It is wise
 * not to divulge more information than necessary.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setPolicy&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the system-wide security policy (specifically,
 * the Policy object)&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Granting this permission is extremely dangerous, as malicious
 * code may grant itself all the necessary permissions it needs
 * to successfully mount an attack on the system.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;createPolicy.{policy type}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Getting an instance of a Policy implementation from a provider&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Granting this permission enables code to obtain a Policy object.
 * Malicious code may query the Policy object to determine what permissions
 * have been granted to code other than itself. &lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;getProperty.{key}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of the security property with the specified key&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Depending on the particular key for which access has
 * been granted, the code may have access to the list of security
 * providers, as well as the location of the system-wide and user
 * security policies.  while revealing this information does not
 * compromise the security of the system, it does provide malicious
 * code with additional information which it may use to better aim
 * an attack.
&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setProperty.{key}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the security property with the specified key&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This could include setting a security provider or defining
 * the location of the system-wide security policy.  Malicious
 * code that has permission to set a new security provider may
 * set a rogue provider that steals confidential information such
 * as cryptographic private keys. In addition, malicious code with
 * permission to set the location of the system-wide security policy
 * may point it to a security policy that grants the attacker
 * all the necessary permissions it requires to successfully mount
 * an attack on the system.
&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;insertProvider&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Addition of a new provider&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow somebody to introduce a possibly
 * malicious provider (e.g., one that discloses the private keys passed
 * to it) as the highest-priority provider. This would be possible
 * because the Security object (which manages the installed providers)
 * currently does not check the integrity or authenticity of a provider
 * before attaching it. The &quot;insertProvider&quot; permission subsumes the
 * &quot;insertProvider.{provider name}&quot; permission (see the section below for
 * more information).
 * &lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;removeProvider.{provider name}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Removal of the specified provider&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This may change the behavior or disable execution of other
 * parts of the program. If a provider subsequently requested by the
 * program has been removed, execution may fail. Also, if the removed
 * provider is not explicitly requested by the rest of the program, but
 * it would normally be the provider chosen when a cryptography service
 * is requested (due to its previous order in the list of providers),
 * a different provider will be chosen instead, or no suitable provider
 * will be found, thereby resulting in program failure.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;clearProviderProperties.{provider name}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;&quot;Clearing&quot; of a Provider so that it no longer contains the properties
 * used to look up services implemented by the provider&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This disables the lookup of services implemented by the provider.
 * This may thus change the behavior or disable execution of other
 * parts of the program that would normally utilize the Provider, as
 * described under the &quot;removeProvider.{provider name}&quot; permission.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;putProviderProperty.{provider name}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of properties for the specified Provider&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;The provider properties each specify the name and location
 * of a particular service implemented by the provider. By granting
 * this permission, you let code replace the service specification
 * with another one, thereby specifying a different implementation.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;removeProviderProperty.{provider name}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Removal of properties from the specified Provider&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This disables the lookup of services implemented by the
 * provider. They are no longer accessible due to removal of the properties
 * specifying their names and locations. This
 * may change the behavior or disable execution of other
 * parts of the program that would normally utilize the Provider, as
 * described under the &quot;removeProvider.{provider name}&quot; permission.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The following permissions have been superseded by newer permissions or are
 * associated with classes that have been deprecated: {@link Identity},
 * {@link IdentityScope}, {@link Signer}. Use of them is discouraged. See the
 * applicable classes for more information.
 *
 * &lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary=&quot;target name,what the permission allows, and associated risks&quot;&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;Permission Target Name&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;What the Permission Allows&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;th&gt;Risks of Allowing this Permission&lt;/th&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;insertProvider.{provider name}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Addition of a new provider, with the specified name&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Use of this permission is discouraged from further use because it is
 * possible to circumvent the name restrictions by overriding the
 * {@link java.security.Provider#getName} method. Also, there is an equivalent
 * level of risk associated with granting code permission to insert a provider
 * with a specific name, or any name it chooses. Users should use the
 * &quot;insertProvider&quot; permission instead.
 * &lt;p&gt;This would allow somebody to introduce a possibly
 * malicious provider (e.g., one that discloses the private keys passed
 * to it) as the highest-priority provider. This would be possible
 * because the Security object (which manages the installed providers)
 * currently does not check the integrity or authenticity of a provider
 * before attaching it.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setSystemScope&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the system identity scope&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow an attacker to configure the system identity scope with
 * certificates that should not be trusted, thereby granting applet or
 * application code signed with those certificates privileges that
 * would have been denied by the system's original identity scope.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setIdentityPublicKey&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the public key for an Identity&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;If the identity is marked as &quot;trusted&quot;, this allows an attacker to
 * introduce a different public key (e.g., its own) that is not trusted
 * by the system's identity scope, thereby granting applet or
 * application code signed with that public key privileges that
 * would have been denied otherwise.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setIdentityInfo&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of a general information string for an Identity&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This allows attackers to set the general description for
 * an identity.  This may trick applications into using a different
 * identity than intended or may prevent applications from finding a
 * particular identity.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;addIdentityCertificate&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Addition of a certificate for an Identity&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This allows attackers to set a certificate for
 * an identity's public key.  This is dangerous because it affects
 * the trust relationship across the system. This public key suddenly
 * becomes trusted to a wider audience than it otherwise would be.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;removeIdentityCertificate&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Removal of a certificate for an Identity&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This allows attackers to remove a certificate for
 * an identity's public key. This is dangerous because it affects
 * the trust relationship across the system. This public key suddenly
 * becomes considered less trustworthy than it otherwise would be.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *  &lt;td&gt;printIdentity&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;td&gt;Viewing the name of a principal
 * and optionally the scope in which it is used, and whether
 * or not it is considered &quot;trusted&quot; in that scope&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;td&gt;The scope that is printed out may be a filename, in which case
 * it may convey local system information. For example, here's a sample
 * printout of an identity named &quot;carol&quot;, who is
 * marked not trusted in the user's identity database:&lt;br&gt;
 *   carol[/home/luehe/identitydb.obj][not trusted]&lt;/td&gt;
 *&lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;getSignerPrivateKey&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of a Signer's private key&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;It is very dangerous to allow access to a private key; private
 * keys are supposed to be kept secret. Otherwise, code can use the
 * private key to sign various files and claim the signature came from
 * the Signer.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;setSignerKeyPair&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the key pair (public key and private key) for a Signer&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow an attacker to replace somebody else's (the &quot;target's&quot;)
 * keypair with a possibly weaker keypair (e.g., a keypair of a smaller
 * keysize).  This also would allow the attacker to listen in on encrypted
 * communication between the target and its peers. The target's peers
 * might wrap an encryption session key under the target's &quot;new&quot; public
 * key, which would allow the attacker (who possesses the corresponding
 * private key) to unwrap the session key and decipher the communication
 * data encrypted under that session key.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 *
