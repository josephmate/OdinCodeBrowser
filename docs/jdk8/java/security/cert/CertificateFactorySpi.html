 * All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 * cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 * of a certificate factory for a particular certificate type, e.g., X.509.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Certificate factories are used to generate certificate, certification path
 * ({@code CertPath}) and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from
 * their encodings.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an
 * instance of {@code java.security.cert.X509Certificate}, and CRLs
 * that are an instance of {@code java.security.cert.X509CRL}.
