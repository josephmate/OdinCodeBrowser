/**
 * An immutable sequence of certificates (a certification path).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This is an abstract class that defines the methods common to all
 * {@code CertPath}s. Subclasses can handle different kinds of
 * certificates (X.509, PGP, etc.).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * All {@code CertPath} objects have a type, a list of
 * {@code Certificate}s, and one or more supported encodings. Because the
 * {@code CertPath} class is immutable, a {@code CertPath} cannot
 * change in any externally visible way after being constructed. This
 * stipulation applies to all public fields and methods of this class and any
 * added or overridden by subclasses.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The type is a {@code String} that identifies the type of
 * {@code Certificate}s in the certification path. For each
 * certificate {@code cert} in a certification path {@code certPath},
 * {@code cert.getType().equals(certPath.getType())} must be
 * {@code true}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The list of {@code Certificate}s is an ordered {@code List} of
 * zero or more {@code Certificate}s. This {@code List} and all
 * of the {@code Certificate}s contained in it must be immutable.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each {@code CertPath} object must support one or more encodings
 * so that the object can be translated into a byte array for storage or
 * transmission to other parties. Preferably, these encodings should be
 * well-documented standards (such as PKCS#7). One of the encodings supported
 * by a {@code CertPath} is considered the default encoding. This
 * encoding is used if no encoding is explicitly requested (for the
 * {@link #getEncoded() getEncoded()} method, for instance).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * All {@code CertPath} objects are also {@code Serializable}.
 * {@code CertPath} objects are resolved into an alternate
 * {@link CertPathRep CertPathRep} object during serialization. This allows
 * a {@code CertPath} object to be serialized into an equivalent
 * representation regardless of its underlying implementation.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@code CertPath} objects can be created with a
 * {@code CertificateFactory} or they can be returned by other classes,
 * such as a {@code CertPathBuilder}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By convention, X.509 {@code CertPath}s (consisting of
 * {@code X509Certificate}s), are ordered starting with the target
 * certificate and ending with a certificate issued by the trust anchor. That
 * is, the issuer of one certificate is the subject of the following one. The
 * certificate representing the {@link TrustAnchor TrustAnchor} should not be
 * included in the certification path. Unvalidated X.509 {@code CertPath}s
 * may not follow these conventions. PKIX {@code CertPathValidator}s will
 * detect any departure from these conventions that cause the certification
 * path to be invalid and throw a {@code CertPathValidatorException}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
 * following standard {@code CertPath} encodings:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@code PKCS7}&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@code PkiPath}&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * These encodings are described in the &lt;a href=
 * &quot;{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#CertPathEncodings&quot;&gt;
 * CertPath Encodings section&lt;/a&gt; of the
 * Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation.
 * Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
 * other encodings are supported.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;Concurrent Access&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * All {@code CertPath} objects must be thread-safe. That is, multiple
 * threads may concurrently invoke the methods defined in this class on a
 * single {@code CertPath} object (or more than one) with no
 * ill effects. This is also true for the {@code List} returned by
 * {@code CertPath.getCertificates}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Requiring {@code CertPath} objects to be immutable and thread-safe
 * allows them to be passed around to various pieces of code without worrying
 * about coordinating access.  Providing this thread-safety is
 * generally not difficult, since the {@code CertPath} and
 * {@code List} objects in question are immutable.
