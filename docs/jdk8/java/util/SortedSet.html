/**
 * A {@link Set} that further provides a &lt;i&gt;total ordering&lt;/i&gt; on its elements.
 * The elements are ordered using their {@linkplain Comparable natural
 * ordering}, or by a {@link Comparator} typically provided at sorted
 * set creation time.  The set's iterator will traverse the set in
 * ascending element order. Several additional operations are provided
 * to take advantage of the ordering.  (This interface is the set
 * analogue of {@link SortedMap}.)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;All elements inserted into a sorted set must implement the &lt;tt&gt;Comparable&lt;/tt&gt;
 * interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator).  Furthermore, all
 * such elements must be &lt;i&gt;mutually comparable&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;tt&gt;e1.compareTo(e2)&lt;/tt&gt;
 * (or &lt;tt&gt;comparator.compare(e1, e2)&lt;/tt&gt;) must not throw a
 * &lt;tt&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/tt&gt; for any elements &lt;tt&gt;e1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;e2&lt;/tt&gt; in
 * the sorted set.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 * offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 * &lt;tt&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be &lt;i&gt;consistent with equals&lt;/i&gt; if
 * the sorted set is to correctly implement the &lt;tt&gt;Set&lt;/tt&gt; interface.  (See
 * the &lt;tt&gt;Comparable&lt;/tt&gt; interface or &lt;tt&gt;Comparator&lt;/tt&gt; interface for a
 * precise definition of &lt;i&gt;consistent with equals&lt;/i&gt;.)  This is so because
 * the &lt;tt&gt;Set&lt;/tt&gt; interface is defined in terms of the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt;
 * operation, but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its
 * &lt;tt&gt;compareTo&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;compare&lt;/tt&gt;) method, so two elements that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set,
 * equal.  The behavior of a sorted set &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the &lt;tt&gt;Set&lt;/tt&gt; interface.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;All general-purpose sorted set implementation classes should
 * provide four &quot;standard&quot; constructors: 1) A void (no arguments)
 * constructor, which creates an empty sorted set sorted according to
 * the natural ordering of its elements.  2) A constructor with a
 * single argument of type &lt;tt&gt;Comparator&lt;/tt&gt;, which creates an empty
 * sorted set sorted according to the specified comparator.  3) A
 * constructor with a single argument of type &lt;tt&gt;Collection&lt;/tt&gt;,
 * which creates a new sorted set with the same elements as its
 * argument, sorted according to the natural ordering of the elements.
 * 4) A constructor with a single argument of type &lt;tt&gt;SortedSet&lt;/tt&gt;,
 * which creates a new sorted set with the same elements and the same
 * ordering as the input sorted set.  There is no way to enforce this
 * recommendation, as interfaces cannot contain constructors.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note: several methods return subsets with restricted ranges.
 * Such ranges are &lt;i&gt;half-open&lt;/i&gt;, that is, they include their low
 * endpoint but not their high endpoint (where applicable).
 * If you need a &lt;i&gt;closed range&lt;/i&gt; (which includes both endpoints), and
 * the element type allows for calculation of the successor of a given
 * value, merely request the subrange from &lt;tt&gt;lowEndpoint&lt;/tt&gt; to
 * &lt;tt&gt;successor(highEndpoint)&lt;/tt&gt;.  For example, suppose that &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt;
 * is a sorted set of strings.  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the strings in &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt; from &lt;tt&gt;low&lt;/tt&gt; to
 * &lt;tt&gt;high&lt;/tt&gt;, inclusive:&lt;pre&gt;
 *   SortedSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; sub = s.subSet(low, high+&quot;\0&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * A similar technique can be used to generate an &lt;i&gt;open range&lt;/i&gt; (which
 * contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the Strings in &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt; from &lt;tt&gt;low&lt;/tt&gt; to
 * &lt;tt&gt;high&lt;/tt&gt;, exclusive:&lt;pre&gt;
 *   SortedSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; sub = s.subSet(low+&quot;\0&quot;, high);&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface is a member of the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html&quot;&gt;
 * Java Collections Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
