/**
 * Marker interface used by &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt; implementations to indicate that
 * they support fast (generally constant time) random access.  The primary
 * purpose of this interface is to allow generic algorithms to alter their
 * behavior to provide good performance when applied to either random or
 * sequential access lists.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The best algorithms for manipulating random access lists (such as
 * &lt;tt&gt;ArrayList&lt;/tt&gt;) can produce quadratic behavior when applied to
 * sequential access lists (such as &lt;tt&gt;LinkedList&lt;/tt&gt;).  Generic list
 * algorithms are encouraged to check whether the given list is an
 * &lt;tt&gt;instanceof&lt;/tt&gt; this interface before applying an algorithm that would
 * provide poor performance if it were applied to a sequential access list,
 * and to alter their behavior if necessary to guarantee acceptable
 * performance.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;It is recognized that the distinction between random and sequential
 * access is often fuzzy.  For example, some &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt; implementations
 * provide asymptotically linear access times if they get huge, but constant
 * access times in practice.  Such a &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt; implementation
 * should generally implement this interface.  As a rule of thumb, a
 * &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt; implementation should implement this interface if,
 * for typical instances of the class, this loop:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     for (int i=0, n=list.size(); i &amp;lt; n; i++)
 *         list.get(i);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * runs faster than this loop:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     for (Iterator i=list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
 *         i.next();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface is a member of the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html&quot;&gt;
 * Java Collections Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
