/**
 * An engine that performs match operations on a {@linkplain java.lang.CharSequence
 * character sequence} by interpreting a {@link Pattern}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A matcher is created from a pattern by invoking the pattern's {@link
 * Pattern#matcher matcher} method.  Once created, a matcher can be used to
 * perform three different kinds of match operations:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #matches matches} method attempts to match the entire
 *   input sequence against the pattern.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #lookingAt lookingAt} method attempts to match the
 *   input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #find find} method scans the input sequence looking for
 *   the next subsequence that matches the pattern.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Each of these methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure.
 * More information about a successful match can be obtained by querying the
 * state of the matcher.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A matcher finds matches in a subset of its input called the
 * &lt;i&gt;region&lt;/i&gt;. By default, the region contains all of the matcher's input.
 * The region can be modified via the{@link #region region} method and queried
 * via the {@link #regionStart regionStart} and {@link #regionEnd regionEnd}
 * methods. The way that the region boundaries interact with some pattern
 * constructs can be changed. See {@link #useAnchoringBounds
 * useAnchoringBounds} and {@link #useTransparentBounds useTransparentBounds}
 * for more details.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; This class also defines methods for replacing matched subsequences with
 * new strings whose contents can, if desired, be computed from the match
 * result.  The {@link #appendReplacement appendReplacement} and {@link
 * #appendTail appendTail} methods can be used in tandem in order to collect
 * the result into an existing string buffer, or the more convenient {@link
 * #replaceAll replaceAll} method can be used to create a string in which every
 * matching subsequence in the input sequence is replaced.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The explicit state of a matcher includes the start and end indices of
 * the most recent successful match.  It also includes the start and end
 * indices of the input subsequence captured by each &lt;a
 * href=&quot;Pattern.html#cg&quot;&gt;capturing group&lt;/a&gt; in the pattern as well as a total
 * count of such subsequences.  As a convenience, methods are also provided for
 * returning these captured subsequences in string form.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The explicit state of a matcher is initially undefined; attempting to
 * query any part of it before a successful match will cause an {@link
 * IllegalStateException} to be thrown.  The explicit state of a matcher is
 * recomputed by every match operation.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The implicit state of a matcher includes the input character sequence as
 * well as the &lt;i&gt;append position&lt;/i&gt;, which is initially zero and is updated
 * by the {@link #appendReplacement appendReplacement} method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A matcher may be reset explicitly by invoking its {@link #reset()}
 * method or, if a new input sequence is desired, its {@link
 * #reset(java.lang.CharSequence) reset(CharSequence)} method.  Resetting a
 * matcher discards its explicit state information and sets the append position
 * to zero.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
 * threads. &lt;/p&gt;
