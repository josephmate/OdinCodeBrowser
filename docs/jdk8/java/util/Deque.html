/**
 * A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at
 * both ends.  The name &lt;i&gt;deque&lt;/i&gt; is short for &quot;double ended queue&quot;
 * and is usually pronounced &quot;deck&quot;.  Most {@code Deque}
 * implementations place no fixed limits on the number of elements
 * they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted
 * deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface defines methods to access the elements at both
 * ends of the deque.  Methods are provided to insert, remove, and
 * examine the element.  Each of these methods exists in two forms:
 * one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a
 * special value (either {@code null} or {@code false}, depending on
 * the operation).  The latter form of the insert operation is
 * designed specifically for use with capacity-restricted
 * {@code Deque} implementations; in most implementations, insert
 * operations cannot fail.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The twelve methods described above are summarized in the
 * following table:
 *
 * &lt;table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1&gt;
 * &lt;caption&gt;Summary of Deque methods&lt;/caption&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN = 2&gt; &lt;b&gt;First Element (Head)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN = 2&gt; &lt;b&gt;Last Element (Tail)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;em&gt;Throws exception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;em&gt;Throws exception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#addFirst addFirst(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#offerFirst offerFirst(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#addLast addLast(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#offerLast offerLast(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remove&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#removeFirst removeFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#pollFirst pollFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#removeLast removeLast()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#pollLast pollLast()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#getFirst getFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#peekFirst peekFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#getLast getLast()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link Deque#peekLast peekLast()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface extends the {@link Queue} interface.  When a deque is
 * used as a queue, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior results.  Elements are
 * added at the end of the deque and removed from the beginning.  The methods
 * inherited from the {@code Queue} interface are precisely equivalent to
 * {@code Deque} methods as indicated in the following table:
 *
 * &lt;table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1&gt;
 * &lt;caption&gt;Comparison of Queue and Deque methods&lt;/caption&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt; &lt;b&gt;{@code Queue} Method&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equivalent {@code Deque} Method&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link java.util.Queue#add add(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #addLast addLast(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link java.util.Queue#offer offer(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #offerLast offerLast(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link java.util.Queue#remove remove()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #removeFirst removeFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link java.util.Queue#poll poll()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #pollFirst pollFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link java.util.Queue#element element()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #getFirst getFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link java.util.Queue#peek peek()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #peek peekFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Deques can also be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks.  This
 * interface should be used in preference to the legacy {@link Stack} class.
 * When a deque is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the
 * beginning of the deque.  Stack methods are precisely equivalent to
 * {@code Deque} methods as indicated in the table below:
 *
 * &lt;table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1&gt;
 * &lt;caption&gt;Comparison of Stack and Deque methods&lt;/caption&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt; &lt;b&gt;Stack Method&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equivalent {@code Deque} Method&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #push push(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #addFirst addFirst(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #pop pop()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #removeFirst removeFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #peek peek()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #peekFirst peekFirst()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note that the {@link #peek peek} method works equally well when
 * a deque is used as a queue or a stack; in either case, elements are
 * drawn from the beginning of the deque.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface provides two methods to remove interior
 * elements, {@link #removeFirstOccurrence removeFirstOccurrence} and
 * {@link #removeLastOccurrence removeLastOccurrence}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Unlike the {@link List} interface, this interface does not
 * provide support for indexed access to elements.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;While {@code Deque} implementations are not strictly required
 * to prohibit the insertion of null elements, they are strongly
 * encouraged to do so.  Users of any {@code Deque} implementations
 * that do allow null elements are strongly encouraged &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to
 * take advantage of the ability to insert nulls.  This is so because
 * {@code null} is used as a special return value by various methods
 * to indicated that the deque is empty.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@code Deque} implementations generally do not define
 * element-based versions of the {@code equals} and {@code hashCode}
 * methods, but instead inherit the identity-based versions from class
 * {@code Object}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface is a member of the &lt;a
 * href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html&quot;&gt; Java Collections
 * Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
