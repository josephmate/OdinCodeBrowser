/**
 * A {@link Map} that further provides a &lt;em&gt;total ordering&lt;/em&gt; on its keys.
 * The map is ordered according to the {@linkplain Comparable natural
 * ordering} of its keys, or by a {@link Comparator} typically
 * provided at sorted map creation time.  This order is reflected when
 * iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the
 * {@code entrySet}, {@code keySet} and {@code values} methods).
 * Several additional operations are provided to take advantage of the
 * ordering.  (This interface is the map analogue of {@link SortedSet}.)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the {@code Comparable}
 * interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator).  Furthermore, all
 * such keys must be &lt;em&gt;mutually comparable&lt;/em&gt;: {@code k1.compareTo(k2)} (or
 * {@code comparator.compare(k1, k2)}) must not throw a
 * {@code ClassCastException} for any keys {@code k1} and {@code k2} in
 * the sorted map.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 * offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 * {@code ClassCastException}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be &lt;em&gt;consistent with equals&lt;/em&gt; if
 * the sorted map is to correctly implement the {@code Map} interface.  (See
 * the {@code Comparable} interface or {@code Comparator} interface for a
 * precise definition of &lt;em&gt;consistent with equals&lt;/em&gt;.)  This is so because
 * the {@code Map} interface is defined in terms of the {@code equals}
 * operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its
 * {@code compareTo} (or {@code compare}) method, so two keys that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,
 * equal.  The behavior of a tree map &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the {@code Map} interface.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four
 * &quot;standard&quot; constructors. It is not possible to enforce this recommendation
 * though as required constructors cannot be specified by interfaces. The
 * expected &quot;standard&quot; constructors for all sorted map implementations are:
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;A void (no arguments) constructor, which creates an empty sorted map
 *   sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys.&lt;/li&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;A constructor with a single argument of type {@code Comparator}, which
 *   creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the specified comparator.&lt;/li&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;A constructor with a single argument of type {@code Map}, which creates
 *   a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument, sorted
 *   according to the keys' natural ordering.&lt;/li&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;A constructor with a single argument of type {@code SortedMap}, which
 *   creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings and the same
 *   ordering as the input sorted map.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: several methods return submaps with restricted key
 * ranges. Such ranges are &lt;em&gt;half-open&lt;/em&gt;, that is, they include their low
 * endpoint but not their high endpoint (where applicable).  If you need a
 * &lt;em&gt;closed range&lt;/em&gt; (which includes both endpoints), and the key type
 * allows for calculation of the successor of a given key, merely request
 * the subrange from {@code lowEndpoint} to
 * {@code successor(highEndpoint)}.  For example, suppose that {@code m}
 * is a map whose keys are strings.  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the key-value mappings in {@code m} whose keys are
 * between {@code low} and {@code high}, inclusive:&lt;pre&gt;
 *   SortedMap&amp;lt;String, V&amp;gt; sub = m.subMap(low, high+&quot;\0&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * A similar technique can be used to generate an &lt;em&gt;open range&lt;/em&gt;
 * (which contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a
 * view containing all of the key-value mappings in {@code m} whose keys
 * are between {@code low} and {@code high}, exclusive:&lt;pre&gt;
 *   SortedMap&amp;lt;String, V&amp;gt; sub = m.subMap(low+&quot;\0&quot;, high);&lt;/pre&gt;
 *

 * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html&quot;&gt;
