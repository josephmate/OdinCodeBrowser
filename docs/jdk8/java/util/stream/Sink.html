/**
 * An extension of {@link Consumer} used to conduct values through the stages of
 * a stream pipeline, with additional methods to manage size information,
 * control flow, etc.  Before calling the {@code accept()} method on a
 * {@code Sink} for the first time, you must first call the {@code begin()}
 * method to inform it that data is coming (optionally informing the sink how
 * much data is coming), and after all data has been sent, you must call the
 * {@code end()} method.  After calling {@code end()}, you should not call
 * {@code accept()} without again calling {@code begin()}.  {@code Sink} also
 * offers a mechanism by which the sink can cooperatively signal that it does
 * not wish to receive any more data (the {@code cancellationRequested()}
 * method), which a source can poll before sending more data to the
 * {@code Sink}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A sink may be in one of two states: an initial state and an active state.
 * It starts out in the initial state; the {@code begin()} method transitions
 * it to the active state, and the {@code end()} method transitions it back into
 * the initial state, where it can be re-used.  Data-accepting methods (such as
 * {@code accept()} are only valid in the active state.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * A stream pipeline consists of a source, zero or more intermediate stages
 * (such as filtering or mapping), and a terminal stage, such as reduction or
 * for-each.  For concreteness, consider the pipeline:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *     int longestStringLengthStartingWithA
 *         = strings.stream()
 *                  .filter(s -&gt; s.startsWith(&quot;A&quot;))
 *                  .mapToInt(String::length)
 *                  .max();
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Here, we have three stages, filtering, mapping, and reducing.  The
 * filtering stage consumes strings and emits a subset of those strings; the
 * mapping stage consumes strings and emits ints; the reduction stage consumes
 * those ints and computes the maximal value.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A {@code Sink} instance is used to represent each stage of this pipeline,
 * whether the stage accepts objects, ints, longs, or doubles.  Sink has entry
 * points for {@code accept(Object)}, {@code accept(int)}, etc, so that we do
 * not need a specialized interface for each primitive specialization.  (It
 * might be called a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; for this omnivorous tendency.)  The entry
 * point to the pipeline is the {@code Sink} for the filtering stage, which
 * sends some elements &quot;downstream&quot; -- into the {@code Sink} for the mapping
 * stage, which in turn sends integral values downstream into the {@code Sink}
 * for the reduction stage. The {@code Sink} implementations associated with a
 * given stage is expected to know the data type for the next stage, and call
 * the correct {@code accept} method on its downstream {@code Sink}.  Similarly,
 * each stage must implement the correct {@code accept} method corresponding to
 * the data type it accepts.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The specialized subtypes such as {@link Sink.OfInt} override
 * {@code accept(Object)} to call the appropriate primitive specialization of
 * {@code accept}, implement the appropriate primitive specialization of
 * {@code Consumer}, and re-abstract the appropriate primitive specialization of
 * {@code accept}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The chaining subtypes such as {@link ChainedInt} not only implement
 * {@code Sink.OfInt}, but also maintain a {@code downstream} field which
 * represents the downstream {@code Sink}, and implement the methods
 * {@code begin()}, {@code end()}, and {@code cancellationRequested()} to
 * delegate to the downstream {@code Sink}.  Most implementations of
 * intermediate operations will use these chaining wrappers.  For example, the
 * mapping stage in the above example would look like:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *     IntSink is = new Sink.ChainedReference&lt;U&gt;(sink) {
 *         public void accept(U u) {
 *             downstream.accept(mapper.applyAsInt(u));
 *         }
 *     };
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Here, we implement {@code Sink.ChainedReference&lt;U&gt;}, meaning that we expect
 * to receive elements of type {@code U} as input, and pass the downstream sink
 * to the constructor.  Because the next stage expects to receive integers, we
 * must call the {@code accept(int)} method when emitting values to the downstream.
 * The {@code accept()} method applies the mapping function from {@code U} to
 * {@code int} and passes the resulting value to the downstream {@code Sink}.
 *
 * @param &lt;T&gt; type of elements for value streams
 * @since 1.8
