/**
 * A &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#Reduction&quot;&gt;mutable reduction operation&lt;/a&gt; that
 * accumulates input elements into a mutable result container, optionally transforming
 * the accumulated result into a final representation after all input elements
 * have been processed.  Reduction operations can be performed either sequentially
 * or in parallel.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Examples of mutable reduction operations include:
 * accumulating elements into a {@code Collection}; concatenating
 * strings using a {@code StringBuilder}; computing summary information about
 * elements such as sum, min, max, or average; computing &quot;pivot table&quot; summaries
 * such as &quot;maximum valued transaction by seller&quot;, etc.  The class {@link Collectors}
 * provides implementations of many common mutable reductions.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A {@code Collector} is specified by four functions that work together to
 * accumulate entries into a mutable result container, and optionally perform
 * a final transform on the result.  They are: &lt;ul&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;creation of a new result container ({@link #supplier()})&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;incorporating a new data element into a result container ({@link #accumulator()})&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;combining two result containers into one ({@link #combiner()})&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;performing an optional final transform on the container ({@link #finisher()})&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Collectors also have a set of characteristics, such as
 * {@link Characteristics#CONCURRENT}, that provide hints that can be used by a
 * reduction implementation to provide better performance.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A sequential implementation of a reduction using a collector would
 * create a single result container using the supplier function, and invoke the
 * accumulator function once for each input element.  A parallel implementation
 * would partition the input, create a result container for each partition,
 * accumulate the contents of each partition into a subresult for that partition,
 * and then use the combiner function to merge the subresults into a combined
 * result.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To ensure that sequential and parallel executions produce equivalent
 * results, the collector functions must satisfy an &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; and an
 * &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#Associativity&quot;&gt;associativity&lt;/a&gt; constraints.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The identity constraint says that for any partially accumulated result,
 * combining it with an empty result container must produce an equivalent
 * result.  That is, for a partially accumulated result {@code a} that is the
 * result of any series of accumulator and combiner invocations, {@code a} must
 * be equivalent to {@code combiner.apply(a, supplier.get())}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The associativity constraint says that splitting the computation must
 * produce an equivalent result.  That is, for any input elements {@code t1}
 * and {@code t2}, the results {@code r1} and {@code r2} in the computation
 * below must be equivalent:
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *     A a1 = supplier.get();
 *     accumulator.accept(a1, t1);
 *     accumulator.accept(a1, t2);
 *     R r1 = finisher.apply(a1);  // result without splitting
 *
 *     A a2 = supplier.get();
 *     accumulator.accept(a2, t1);
 *     A a3 = supplier.get();
 *     accumulator.accept(a3, t2);
 *     R r2 = finisher.apply(combiner.apply(a2, a3));  // result with splitting
 * } &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;For collectors that do not have the {@code UNORDERED} characteristic,
 * two accumulated results {@code a1} and {@code a2} are equivalent if
 * {@code finisher.apply(a1).equals(finisher.apply(a2))}.  For unordered
 * collectors, equivalence is relaxed to allow for non-equality related to
 * differences in order.  (For example, an unordered collector that accumulated
 * elements to a {@code List} would consider two lists equivalent if they
 * contained the same elements, ignoring order.)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Libraries that implement reduction based on {@code Collector}, such as
 * {@link Stream#collect(Collector)}, must adhere to the following constraints:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;The first argument passed to the accumulator function, both
 *     arguments passed to the combiner function, and the argument passed to the
 *     finisher function must be the result of a previous invocation of the
 *     result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions.&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;The implementation should not do anything with the result of any of
 *     the result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions other than to
 *     pass them again to the accumulator, combiner, or finisher functions,
 *     or return them to the caller of the reduction operation.&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;If a result is passed to the combiner or finisher
 *     function, and the same object is not returned from that function, it is
 *     never used again.&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;Once a result is passed to the combiner or finisher function, it
 *     is never passed to the accumulator function again.&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;For non-concurrent collectors, any result returned from the result
 *     supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions must be serially
 *     thread-confined.  This enables collection to occur in parallel without
 *     the {@code Collector} needing to implement any additional synchronization.
 *     The reduction implementation must manage that the input is properly
 *     partitioned, that partitions are processed in isolation, and combining
 *     happens only after accumulation is complete.&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;For concurrent collectors, an implementation is free to (but not
 *     required to) implement reduction concurrently.  A concurrent reduction
 *     is one where the accumulator function is called concurrently from
 *     multiple threads, using the same concurrently-modifiable result container,
 *     rather than keeping the result isolated during accumulation.
 *     A concurrent reduction should only be applied if the collector has the
 *     {@link Characteristics#UNORDERED} characteristics or if the
 *     originating data is unordered.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In addition to the predefined implementations in {@link Collectors}, the
 * static factory methods {@link #of(Supplier, BiConsumer, BinaryOperator, Characteristics...)}
 * can be used to construct collectors.  For example, you could create a collector
 * that accumulates widgets into a {@code TreeSet} with:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *     Collector&lt;Widget, ?, TreeSet&lt;Widget&gt;&gt; intoSet =
 *         Collector.of(TreeSet::new, TreeSet::add,
 *                      (left, right) -&gt; { left.addAll(right); return left; });
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * (This behavior is also implemented by the predefined collector
 * {@link Collectors#toCollection(Supplier)}).
 *
 * @apiNote
 * Performing a reduction operation with a {@code Collector} should produce a
 * result equivalent to:
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *     R container = collector.supplier().get();
 *     for (T t : data)
 *         collector.accumulator().accept(container, t);
 *     return collector.finisher().apply(container);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;However, the library is free to partition the input, perform the reduction
 * on the partitions, and then use the combiner function to combine the partial
 * results to achieve a parallel reduction.  (Depending on the specific reduction
 * operation, this may perform better or worse, depending on the relative cost
 * of the accumulator and combiner functions.)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Collectors are designed to be &lt;em&gt;composed&lt;/em&gt;; many of the methods
 * in {@link Collectors} are functions that take a collector and produce
 * a new collector.  For example, given the following collector that computes
 * the sum of the salaries of a stream of employees:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *     Collector&lt;Employee, ?, Integer&gt; summingSalaries
 *         = Collectors.summingInt(Employee::getSalary))
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * If we wanted to create a collector to tabulate the sum of salaries by
 * department, we could reuse the &quot;sum of salaries&quot; logic using
 * {@link Collectors#groupingBy(Function, Collector)}:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *     Collector&lt;Employee, ?, Map&lt;Department, Integer&gt;&gt; summingSalariesByDept
 *         = Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment, summingSalaries);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
