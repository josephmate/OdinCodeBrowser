/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Stack&lt;/code&gt; class represents a last-in-first-out
 * (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class &lt;tt&gt;Vector&lt;/tt&gt; with five
 * operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual
 * &lt;tt&gt;push&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;pop&lt;/tt&gt; operations are provided, as well as a
 * method to &lt;tt&gt;peek&lt;/tt&gt; at the top item on the stack, a method to test
 * for whether the stack is &lt;tt&gt;empty&lt;/tt&gt;, and a method to &lt;tt&gt;search&lt;/tt&gt;
 * the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When a stack is first created, it contains no items.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A more complete and consistent set of LIFO stack operations is
 * provided by the {@link Deque} interface and its implementations, which
 * should be used in preference to this class.  For example:
 * &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
 *   Deque&lt;Integer&gt; stack = new ArrayDeque&lt;Integer&gt;();}&lt;/pre&gt;
