/**
 * A {@link CompletionService} that uses a supplied {@link Executor}
 * to execute tasks.  This class arranges that submitted tasks are,
 * upon completion, placed on a queue accessible using {@code take}.
 * The class is lightweight enough to be suitable for transient use
 * when processing groups of tasks.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;b&gt;Usage Examples.&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * Suppose you have a set of solvers for a certain problem, each
 * returning a value of some type {@code Result}, and would like to
 * run them concurrently, processing the results of each of them that
 * return a non-null value, in some method {@code use(Result r)}. You
 * could write this as:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * void solve(Executor e,
 *            Collection&lt;Callable&lt;Result&gt;&gt; solvers)
 *     throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
 *     CompletionService&lt;Result&gt; ecs
 *         = new ExecutorCompletionService&lt;Result&gt;(e);
 *     for (Callable&lt;Result&gt; s : solvers)
 *         ecs.submit(s);
 *     int n = solvers.size();
 *     for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
 *         Result r = ecs.take().get();
 *         if (r != null)
 *             use(r);
 *     }
 * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * Suppose instead that you would like to use the first non-null result
 * of the set of tasks, ignoring any that encounter exceptions,
 * and cancelling all other tasks when the first one is ready:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * void solve(Executor e,
 *            Collection&lt;Callable&lt;Result&gt;&gt; solvers)
 *     throws InterruptedException {
 *     CompletionService&lt;Result&gt; ecs
 *         = new ExecutorCompletionService&lt;Result&gt;(e);
 *     int n = solvers.size();
 *     List&lt;Future&lt;Result&gt;&gt; futures
 *         = new ArrayList&lt;Future&lt;Result&gt;&gt;(n);
 *     Result result = null;
 *     try {
 *         for (Callable&lt;Result&gt; s : solvers)
 *             futures.add(ecs.submit(s));
 *         for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
 *             try {
 *                 Result r = ecs.take().get();
 *                 if (r != null) {
 *                     result = r;
 *                     break;
 *                 }
 *             } catch (ExecutionException ignore) {}
 *         }
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *         for (Future&lt;Result&gt; f : futures)
 *             f.cancel(true);
 *     }
 *
 *     if (result != null)
 *         use(result);
 * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
