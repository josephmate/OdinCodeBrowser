/**
 * A {@link java.util.Queue} that additionally supports operations
 * that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an
 * element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when
 * storing an element.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@code BlockingQueue} methods come in four forms, with different ways
 * of handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be
 * satisfied at some point in the future:
 * one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either
 * {@code null} or {@code false}, depending on the operation), the third
 * blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed,
 * and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving
 * up.  These methods are summarized in the following table:
 *
 * &lt;table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1&gt;
 * &lt;caption&gt;Summary of BlockingQueue methods&lt;/caption&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;em&gt;Throws exception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #add add(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #offer offer(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #put put(e)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #offer(Object, long, TimeUnit) offer(e, time, unit)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remove&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #remove remove()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #poll poll()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #take take()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #poll(long, TimeUnit) poll(time, unit)}&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #element element()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;{@link #peek peek()}&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;not applicable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *    &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;not applicable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 *  &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A {@code BlockingQueue} does not accept {@code null} elements.
 * Implementations throw {@code NullPointerException} on attempts
 * to {@code add}, {@code put} or {@code offer} a {@code null}.  A
 * {@code null} is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of
 * {@code poll} operations.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A {@code BlockingQueue} may be capacity bounded. At any given
 * time it may have a {@code remainingCapacity} beyond which no
 * additional elements can be {@code put} without blocking.
 * A {@code BlockingQueue} without any intrinsic capacity constraints always
 * reports a remaining capacity of {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@code BlockingQueue} implementations are designed to be used
 * primarily for producer-consumer queues, but additionally support
 * the {@link java.util.Collection} interface.  So, for example, it is
 * possible to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using
 * {@code remove(x)}. However, such operations are in general
 * &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; performed very efficiently, and are intended for only
 * occasional use, such as when a queued message is cancelled.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@code BlockingQueue} implementations are thread-safe.  All
 * queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal
 * locks or other forms of concurrency control. However, the
 * &lt;em&gt;bulk&lt;/em&gt; Collection operations {@code addAll},
 * {@code containsAll}, {@code retainAll} and {@code removeAll} are
 * &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; necessarily performed atomically unless specified
 * otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for
 * {@code addAll(c)} to fail (throwing an exception) after adding
 * only some of the elements in {@code c}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A {@code BlockingQueue} does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; intrinsically support
 * any kind of &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;shutdown&amp;quot; operation to
 * indicate that no more items will be added.  The needs and usage of
 * such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a
 * common tactic is for producers to insert special
 * &lt;em&gt;end-of-stream&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;poison&lt;/em&gt; objects, that are
 * interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.
 * Note that a {@code BlockingQueue} can safely be used with multiple
 * producers and multiple consumers.
 *  &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * class Producer implements Runnable {
 *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
 *   Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       while (true) { queue.put(produce()); }
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *   }
 *   Object produce() { ... }
 * }
 *
 * class Consumer implements Runnable {
 *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
 *   Consumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       while (true) { consume(queue.take()); }
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *   }
 *   void consume(Object x) { ... }
 * }
 *
 * class Setup {
 *   void main() {
 *     BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();
 *     Producer p = new Producer(q);
 *     Consumer c1 = new Consumer(q);
 *     Consumer c2 = new Consumer(q);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 *     new Thread(c1).start();
 *     new Thread(c2).start();
 *   }
 * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
 * collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
 * {@code BlockingQueue}
 * &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 * actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
 * the {@code BlockingQueue} in another thread.
 *
