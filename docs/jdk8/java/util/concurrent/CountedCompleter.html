/**
 * A {@link ForkJoinTask} with a completion action performed when
 * triggered and there are no remaining pending actions.
 * CountedCompleters are in general more robust in the
 * presence of subtask stalls and blockage than are other forms of
 * ForkJoinTasks, but are less intuitive to program.  Uses of
 * CountedCompleter are similar to those of other completion based
 * components (such as {@link java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler})
 * except that multiple &lt;em&gt;pending&lt;/em&gt; completions may be necessary
 * to trigger the completion action {@link #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)},
 * not just one.
 * Unless initialized otherwise, the {@linkplain #getPendingCount pending
 * count} starts at zero, but may be (atomically) changed using
 * methods {@link #setPendingCount}, {@link #addToPendingCount}, and
 * {@link #compareAndSetPendingCount}. Upon invocation of {@link
 * #tryComplete}, if the pending action count is nonzero, it is
 * decremented; otherwise, the completion action is performed, and if
 * this completer itself has a completer, the process is continued
 * with its completer.  As is the case with related synchronization
 * components such as {@link java.util.concurrent.Phaser Phaser} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore Semaphore}, these methods
 * affect only internal counts; they do not establish any further
 * internal bookkeeping. In particular, the identities of pending
 * tasks are not maintained. As illustrated below, you can create
 * subclasses that do record some or all pending tasks or their
 * results when needed.  As illustrated below, utility methods
 * supporting customization of completion traversals are also
 * provided. However, because CountedCompleters provide only basic
 * synchronization mechanisms, it may be useful to create further
 * abstract subclasses that maintain linkages, fields, and additional
 * support methods appropriate for a set of related usages.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A concrete CountedCompleter class must define method {@link
 * #compute}, that should in most cases (as illustrated below), invoke
 * {@code tryComplete()} once before returning. The class may also
 * optionally override method {@link #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)}
 * to perform an action upon normal completion, and method
 * {@link #onExceptionalCompletion(Throwable, CountedCompleter)} to
 * perform an action upon any exception.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;CountedCompleters most often do not bear results, in which case
 * they are normally declared as {@code CountedCompleter&lt;Void&gt;}, and
 * will always return {@code null} as a result value.  In other cases,
 * you should override method {@link #getRawResult} to provide a
 * result from {@code join(), invoke()}, and related methods.  In
 * general, this method should return the value of a field (or a
 * function of one or more fields) of the CountedCompleter object that
 * holds the result upon completion. Method {@link #setRawResult} by
 * default plays no role in CountedCompleters.  It is possible, but
 * rarely applicable, to override this method to maintain other
 * objects or fields holding result data.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A CountedCompleter that does not itself have a completer (i.e.,
 * one for which {@link #getCompleter} returns {@code null}) can be
 * used as a regular ForkJoinTask with this added functionality.
 * However, any completer that in turn has another completer serves
 * only as an internal helper for other computations, so its own task
 * status (as reported in methods such as {@link ForkJoinTask#isDone})
 * is arbitrary; this status changes only upon explicit invocations of
 * {@link #complete}, {@link ForkJoinTask#cancel},
 * {@link ForkJoinTask#completeExceptionally(Throwable)} or upon
 * exceptional completion of method {@code compute}. Upon any
 * exceptional completion, the exception may be relayed to a task's
 * completer (and its completer, and so on), if one exists and it has
 * not otherwise already completed. Similarly, cancelling an internal
 * CountedCompleter has only a local effect on that completer, so is
 * not often useful.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Usages.&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parallel recursive decomposition.&lt;/b&gt; CountedCompleters may
 * be arranged in trees similar to those often used with {@link
 * RecursiveAction}s, although the constructions involved in setting
 * them up typically vary. Here, the completer of each task is its
 * parent in the computation tree. Even though they entail a bit more
 * bookkeeping, CountedCompleters may be better choices when applying
 * a possibly time-consuming operation (that cannot be further
 * subdivided) to each element of an array or collection; especially
 * when the operation takes a significantly different amount of time
 * to complete for some elements than others, either because of
 * intrinsic variation (for example I/O) or auxiliary effects such as
 * garbage collection.  Because CountedCompleters provide their own
 * continuations, other threads need not block waiting to perform
 * them.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;For example, here is an initial version of a class that uses
 * divide-by-two recursive decomposition to divide work into single
 * pieces (leaf tasks). Even when work is split into individual calls,
 * tree-based techniques are usually preferable to directly forking
 * leaf tasks, because they reduce inter-thread communication and
 * improve load balancing. In the recursive case, the second of each
 * pair of subtasks to finish triggers completion of its parent
 * (because no result combination is performed, the default no-op
 * implementation of method {@code onCompletion} is not overridden).
 * A static utility method sets up the base task and invokes it
 * (here, implicitly using the {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()}).
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * class MyOperation&lt;E&gt; { void apply(E e) { ... }  }
 *
 * class ForEach&lt;E&gt; extends CountedCompleter&lt;Void&gt; {
 *
 *   public static &lt;E&gt; void forEach(E[] array, MyOperation&lt;E&gt; op) {
 *     new ForEach&lt;E&gt;(null, array, op, 0, array.length).invoke();
 *   }
 *
 *   final E[] array; final MyOperation&lt;E&gt; op; final int lo, hi;
 *   ForEach(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; p, E[] array, MyOperation&lt;E&gt; op, int lo, int hi) {
 *     super(p);
 *     this.array = array; this.op = op; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *   }
 *
 *   public void compute() { // version 1
 *     if (hi - lo &gt;= 2) {
 *       int mid = (lo + hi) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
 *       setPendingCount(2); // must set pending count before fork
 *       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
 *       new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).fork(); // left child
 *     }
 *     else if (hi &gt; lo)
 *       op.apply(array[lo]);
 *     tryComplete();
 *   }
 * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * This design can be improved by noticing that in the recursive case,
 * the task has nothing to do after forking its right task, so can
 * directly invoke its left task before returning. (This is an analog
 * of tail recursion removal.)  Also, because the task returns upon
 * executing its left task (rather than falling through to invoke
 * {@code tryComplete}) the pending count is set to one:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * class ForEach&lt;E&gt; ...
 *   public void compute() { // version 2
 *     if (hi - lo &gt;= 2) {
 *       int mid = (lo + hi) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
 *       setPendingCount(1); // only one pending
 *       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
 *       new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).compute(); // direct invoke
 *     }
 *     else {
 *       if (hi &gt; lo)
 *         op.apply(array[lo]);
 *       tryComplete();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * As a further improvement, notice that the left task need not even exist.
 * Instead of creating a new one, we can iterate using the original task,
 * and add a pending count for each fork.  Additionally, because no task
 * in this tree implements an {@link #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)} method,
 * {@code tryComplete()} can be replaced with {@link #propagateCompletion}.
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * class ForEach&lt;E&gt; ...
 *   public void compute() { // version 3
 *     int l = lo,  h = hi;
 *     while (h - l &gt;= 2) {
 *       int mid = (l + h) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
 *       addToPendingCount(1);
 *       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, h).fork(); // right child
 *       h = mid;
 *     }
 *     if (h &gt; l)
 *       op.apply(array[l]);
 *     propagateCompletion();
 *   }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * Additional improvements of such classes might entail precomputing
 * pending counts so that they can be established in constructors,
 * specializing classes for leaf steps, subdividing by say, four,
 * instead of two per iteration, and using an adaptive threshold
 * instead of always subdividing down to single elements.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Searching.&lt;/b&gt; A tree of CountedCompleters can search for a
 * value or property in different parts of a data structure, and
 * report a result in an {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference AtomicReference} as
 * soon as one is found. The others can poll the result to avoid
 * unnecessary work. (You could additionally {@linkplain #cancel
 * cancel} other tasks, but it is usually simpler and more efficient
 * to just let them notice that the result is set and if so skip
 * further processing.)  Illustrating again with an array using full
 * partitioning (again, in practice, leaf tasks will almost always
 * process more than one element):
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * class Searcher&lt;E&gt; extends CountedCompleter&lt;E&gt; {
 *   final E[] array; final AtomicReference&lt;E&gt; result; final int lo, hi;
 *   Searcher(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; p, E[] array, AtomicReference&lt;E&gt; result, int lo, int hi) {
 *     super(p);
 *     this.array = array; this.result = result; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *   }
 *   public E getRawResult() { return result.get(); }
 *   public void compute() { // similar to ForEach version 3
 *     int l = lo,  h = hi;
 *     while (result.get() == null &amp;&amp; h &gt;= l) {
 *       if (h - l &gt;= 2) {
 *         int mid = (l + h) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
 *         addToPendingCount(1);
 *         new Searcher(this, array, result, mid, h).fork();
 *         h = mid;
 *       }
 *       else {
 *         E x = array[l];
 *         if (matches(x) &amp;&amp; result.compareAndSet(null, x))
 *           quietlyCompleteRoot(); // root task is now joinable
 *         break;
 *       }
 *     }
 *     tryComplete(); // normally complete whether or not found
 *   }
 *   boolean matches(E e) { ... } // return true if found
 *
 *   public static &lt;E&gt; E search(E[] array) {
 *       return new Searcher&lt;E&gt;(null, array, new AtomicReference&lt;E&gt;(), 0, array.length).invoke();
 *   }
 * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * In this example, as well as others in which tasks have no other
 * effects except to compareAndSet a common result, the trailing
 * unconditional invocation of {@code tryComplete} could be made
 * conditional ({@code if (result.get() == null) tryComplete();})
 * because no further bookkeeping is required to manage completions
 * once the root task completes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recording subtasks.&lt;/b&gt; CountedCompleter tasks that combine
 * results of multiple subtasks usually need to access these results
 * in method {@link #onCompletion(CountedCompleter)}. As illustrated in the following
 * class (that performs a simplified form of map-reduce where mappings
 * and reductions are all of type {@code E}), one way to do this in
 * divide and conquer designs is to have each subtask record its
 * sibling, so that it can be accessed in method {@code onCompletion}.
 * This technique applies to reductions in which the order of
 * combining left and right results does not matter; ordered
 * reductions require explicit left/right designations.  Variants of
 * other streamlinings seen in the above examples may also apply.
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * class MyMapper&lt;E&gt; { E apply(E v) {  ...  } }
 * class MyReducer&lt;E&gt; { E apply(E x, E y) {  ...  } }
 * class MapReducer&lt;E&gt; extends CountedCompleter&lt;E&gt; {
 *   final E[] array; final MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper;
 *   final MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer; final int lo, hi;
 *   MapReducer&lt;E&gt; sibling;
 *   E result;
 *   MapReducer(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; p, E[] array, MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper,
 *              MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer, int lo, int hi) {
 *     super(p);
 *     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
 *     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *   }
 *   public void compute() {
 *     if (hi - lo &gt;= 2) {
 *       int mid = (lo + hi) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
 *       MapReducer&lt;E&gt; left = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, lo, mid);
 *       MapReducer&lt;E&gt; right = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, hi);
 *       left.sibling = right;
 *       right.sibling = left;
 *       setPendingCount(1); // only right is pending
 *       right.fork();
 *       left.compute();     // directly execute left
 *     }
 *     else {
 *       if (hi &gt; lo)
 *           result = mapper.apply(array[lo]);
 *       tryComplete();
 *     }
 *   }
 *   public void onCompletion(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; caller) {
 *     if (caller != this) {
 *       MapReducer&lt;E&gt; child = (MapReducer&lt;E&gt;)caller;
 *       MapReducer&lt;E&gt; sib = child.sibling;
 *       if (sib == null || sib.result == null)
 *         result = child.result;
 *       else
 *         result = reducer.apply(child.result, sib.result);
 *     }
 *   }
 *   public E getRawResult() { return result; }
 *
 *   public static &lt;E&gt; E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper, MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer) {
 *     return new MapReducer&lt;E&gt;(null, array, mapper, reducer,
 *                              0, array.length).invoke();
 *   }
 * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * Here, method {@code onCompletion} takes a form common to many
 * completion designs that combine results. This callback-style method
 * is triggered once per task, in either of the two different contexts
 * in which the pending count is, or becomes, zero: (1) by a task
 * itself, if its pending count is zero upon invocation of {@code
 * tryComplete}, or (2) by any of its subtasks when they complete and
 * decrement the pending count to zero. The {@code caller} argument
 * distinguishes cases.  Most often, when the caller is {@code this},
 * no action is necessary. Otherwise the caller argument can be used
 * (usually via a cast) to supply a value (and/or links to other
 * values) to be combined.  Assuming proper use of pending counts, the
 * actions inside {@code onCompletion} occur (once) upon completion of
 * a task and its subtasks. No additional synchronization is required
 * within this method to ensure thread safety of accesses to fields of
 * this task or other completed tasks.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Completion Traversals&lt;/b&gt;. If using {@code onCompletion} to
 * process completions is inapplicable or inconvenient, you can use
 * methods {@link #firstComplete} and {@link #nextComplete} to create
 * custom traversals.  For example, to define a MapReducer that only
 * splits out right-hand tasks in the form of the third ForEach
 * example, the completions must cooperatively reduce along
 * unexhausted subtask links, which can be done as follows:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * class MapReducer&lt;E&gt; extends CountedCompleter&lt;E&gt; { // version 2
 *   final E[] array; final MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper;
 *   final MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer; final int lo, hi;
 *   MapReducer&lt;E&gt; forks, next; // record subtask forks in list
 *   E result;
 *   MapReducer(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; p, E[] array, MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper,
 *              MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer, int lo, int hi, MapReducer&lt;E&gt; next) {
 *     super(p);
 *     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
 *     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
 *     this.next = next;
 *   }
 *   public void compute() {
 *     int l = lo,  h = hi;
 *     while (h - l &gt;= 2) {
 *       int mid = (l + h) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
 *       addToPendingCount(1);
 *       (forks = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, h, forks)).fork();
 *       h = mid;
 *     }
 *     if (h &gt; l)
 *       result = mapper.apply(array[l]);
 *     // process completions by reducing along and advancing subtask links
 *     for (CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; c = firstComplete(); c != null; c = c.nextComplete()) {
 *       for (MapReducer t = (MapReducer)c, s = t.forks;  s != null; s = t.forks = s.next)
 *         t.result = reducer.apply(t.result, s.result);
 *     }
 *   }
 *   public E getRawResult() { return result; }
 *
 *   public static &lt;E&gt; E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper, MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer) {
 *     return new MapReducer&lt;E&gt;(null, array, mapper, reducer,
 *                              0, array.length, null).invoke();
 *   }
 * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Triggers.&lt;/b&gt; Some CountedCompleters are themselves never
 * forked, but instead serve as bits of plumbing in other designs;
 * including those in which the completion of one or more async tasks
 * triggers another async task. For example:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * class HeaderBuilder extends CountedCompleter&lt;...&gt; { ... }
 * class BodyBuilder extends CountedCompleter&lt;...&gt; { ... }
 * class PacketSender extends CountedCompleter&lt;...&gt; {
 *   PacketSender(...) { super(null, 1); ... } // trigger on second completion
 *   public void compute() { } // never called
 *   public void onCompletion(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; caller) { sendPacket(); }
 * }
 * // sample use:
 * PacketSender p = new PacketSender();
 * new HeaderBuilder(p, ...).fork();
 * new BodyBuilder(p, ...).fork();
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
