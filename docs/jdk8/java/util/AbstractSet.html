 * This class provides a skeletal implementation of the &lt;tt&gt;Set&lt;/tt&gt;
 * interface to minimize the effort required to implement this
 * interface. &lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The process of implementing a set by extending this class is identical
 * to that of implementing a Collection by extending AbstractCollection,
 * except that all of the methods and constructors in subclasses of this
 * class must obey the additional constraints imposed by the &lt;tt&gt;Set&lt;/tt&gt;
 * interface (for instance, the add method must not permit addition of
 * multiple instances of an object to a set).&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * Note that this class does not override any of the implementations from
 * the &lt;tt&gt;AbstractCollection&lt;/tt&gt; class.  It merely adds implementations
 * for &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;hashCode&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
