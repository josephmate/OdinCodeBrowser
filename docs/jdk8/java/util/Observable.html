/**
 * This class represents an observable object, or &quot;data&quot;
 * in the model-view paradigm. It can be subclassed to represent an
 * object that the application wants to have observed.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An observable object can have one or more observers. An observer
 * may be any object that implements interface &lt;tt&gt;Observer&lt;/tt&gt;. After an
 * observable instance changes, an application calling the
 * &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;notifyObservers&lt;/code&gt; method
 * causes all of its observers to be notified of the change by a call
 * to their &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; method.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified.
 * The default implementation provided in the Observable class will
 * notify Observers in the order in which they registered interest, but
 * subclasses may change this order, use no guaranteed order, deliver
 * notifications on separate threads, or may guarantee that their
 * subclass follows this order, as they choose.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that this notification mechanism has nothing to do with threads
 * and is completely separate from the &lt;tt&gt;wait&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;notify&lt;/tt&gt;
 * mechanism of class &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is
 * empty. Two observers are considered the same if and only if the
 * &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; method returns true for them.
