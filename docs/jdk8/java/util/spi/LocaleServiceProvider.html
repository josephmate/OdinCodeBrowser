/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This is the super class of all the locale sensitive service provider
 * interfaces (SPIs).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Locale sensitive  service provider interfaces are interfaces that
 * correspond to locale sensitive classes in the &lt;code&gt;java.text&lt;/code&gt;
 * and &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; packages. The interfaces enable the
 * construction of locale sensitive objects and the retrieval of
 * localized names for these packages. Locale sensitive factory methods
 * and methods for name retrieval in the &lt;code&gt;java.text&lt;/code&gt; and
 * &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; packages use implementations of the provider
 * interfaces to offer support for locales beyond the set of locales
 * supported by the Java runtime environment itself.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Packaging of Locale Sensitive Service Provider Implementations&lt;/h3&gt;
 * Implementations of these locale sensitive services are packaged using the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../technotes/guides/extensions/index.html&quot;&gt;Java Extension Mechanism&lt;/a&gt;
 * as installed extensions.  A provider identifies itself with a
 * provider-configuration file in the resource directory META-INF/services,
 * using the fully qualified provider interface class name as the file name.
 * The file should contain a list of fully-qualified concrete provider class names,
 * one per line. A line is terminated by any one of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage
 * return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. Space
 * and tab characters surrounding each name, as well as blank lines, are ignored.
 * The comment character is '#' ('\u0023'); on each line all characters following
 * the first comment character are ignored. The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one configuration
 * file, or is named in the same configuration file more than once, then the
 * duplicates will be ignored. The configuration file naming a particular provider
 * need not be in the same jar file or other distribution unit as the provider itself.
 * The provider must be accessible from the same class loader that was initially
 * queried to locate the configuration file; this is not necessarily the class loader
 * that loaded the file.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For example, an implementation of the
 * {@link java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider DateFormatProvider} class should
 * take the form of a jar file which contains the file:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * META-INF/services/java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * And the file &lt;code&gt;java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider&lt;/code&gt; should have
 * a line such as:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * &lt;code&gt;com.foo.DateFormatProviderImpl&lt;/code&gt;
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * which is the fully qualified class name of the class implementing
 * &lt;code&gt;DateFormatProvider&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;h4&gt;Invocation of Locale Sensitive Services&lt;/h4&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Locale sensitive factory methods and methods for name retrieval in the
 * &lt;code&gt;java.text&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; packages invoke
 * service provider methods when needed to support the requested locale.
 * The methods first check whether the Java runtime environment itself
 * supports the requested locale, and use its support if available.
 * Otherwise, they call the {@link #isSupportedLocale(Locale) isSupportedLocale}
 * methods of installed providers for the appropriate interface to find one that
 * supports the requested locale. If such a provider is found, its other
 * methods are called to obtain the requested object or name.  When checking
 * whether a locale is supported, the &lt;a href=&quot;../Locale.html#def_extensions&quot;&gt;
 * locale's extensions&lt;/a&gt; are ignored by default. (If locale's extensions should
 * also be checked, the {@code isSupportedLocale} method must be overridden.)
 * If neither the Java runtime environment itself nor an installed provider
 * supports the requested locale, the methods go through a list of candidate
 * locales and repeat the availability check for each until a match is found.
 * The algorithm used for creating a list of candidate locales is same as
 * the one used by &lt;code&gt;ResourceBundle&lt;/code&gt; by default (see
 * {@link java.util.ResourceBundle.Control#getCandidateLocales getCandidateLocales}
 * for the details).  Even if a locale is resolved from the candidate list,
 * methods that return requested objects or names are invoked with the original
 * requested locale including {@code Locale} extensions. The Java runtime
 * environment must support the root locale for all locale sensitive services in
 * order to guarantee that this process terminates.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Providers of names (but not providers of other objects) are allowed to
 * return null for some name requests even for locales that they claim to
 * support by including them in their return value for
 * &lt;code&gt;getAvailableLocales&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, the Java runtime
 * environment itself may not have all names for all locales that it
 * supports. This is because the sets of objects for which names are
 * requested can be large and vary over time, so that it's not always
 * feasible to cover them completely. If the Java runtime environment or a
 * provider returns null instead of a name, the lookup will proceed as
 * described above as if the locale was not supported.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Starting from JDK8, the search order of locale sensitive services can
 * be configured by using the &quot;java.locale.providers&quot; system property.
 * This system property declares the user's preferred order for looking up
 * the locale sensitive services separated by a comma. It is only read at
 * the Java runtime startup, so the later call to System.setProperty() won't
 * affect the order.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For example, if the following is specified in the property:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * java.locale.providers=SPI,JRE
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * where &quot;SPI&quot; represents the locale sensitive services implemented in the
 * installed SPI providers, and &quot;JRE&quot; represents the locale sensitive services
 * in the Java Runtime Environment, the locale sensitive services in the SPI
 * providers are looked up first.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are two other possible locale sensitive service providers, i.e., &quot;CLDR&quot;
 * which is a provider based on Unicode Consortium's
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://cldr.unicode.org/&quot;&gt;CLDR Project&lt;/a&gt;, and &quot;HOST&quot; which is a
 * provider that reflects the user's custom settings in the underlying operating
 * system. These two providers may not be available, depending on the Java Runtime
 * Environment implementation. Specifying &quot;JRE,SPI&quot; is identical to the default
 * behavior, which is compatibile with the prior releases.
