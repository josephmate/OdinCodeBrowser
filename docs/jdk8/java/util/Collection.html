/**
 * The root interface in the &lt;i&gt;collection hierarchy&lt;/i&gt;.  A collection
 * represents a group of objects, known as its &lt;i&gt;elements&lt;/i&gt;.  Some
 * collections allow duplicate elements and others do not.  Some are ordered
 * and others unordered.  The JDK does not provide any &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt;
 * implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more
 * specific subinterfaces like &lt;tt&gt;Set&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt;.  This interface
 * is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where
 * maximum generality is desired.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bags&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;multisets&lt;/i&gt; (unordered collections that may contain
 * duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;All general-purpose &lt;tt&gt;Collection&lt;/tt&gt; implementation classes (which
 * typically implement &lt;tt&gt;Collection&lt;/tt&gt; indirectly through one of its
 * subinterfaces) should provide two &quot;standard&quot; constructors: a void (no
 * arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a
 * constructor with a single argument of type &lt;tt&gt;Collection&lt;/tt&gt;, which
 * creates a new collection with the same elements as its argument.  In
 * effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection,
 * producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type.
 * There is no way to enforce this convention (as interfaces cannot contain
 * constructors) but all of the general-purpose &lt;tt&gt;Collection&lt;/tt&gt;
 * implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The &quot;destructive&quot; methods contained in this interface, that is, the
 * methods that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to
 * throw &lt;tt&gt;UnsupportedOperationException&lt;/tt&gt; if this collection does not
 * support the operation.  If this is the case, these methods may, but are not
 * required to, throw an &lt;tt&gt;UnsupportedOperationException&lt;/tt&gt; if the
 * invocation would have no effect on the collection.  For example, invoking
 * the {@link #addAll(Collection)} method on an unmodifiable collection may,
 * but is not required to, throw the exception if the collection to be added
 * is empty.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;optional-restrictions&quot;&gt;
 * Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.&lt;/a&gt;  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * &lt;tt&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/tt&gt;.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as &quot;optional&quot; in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;It is up to each collection to determine its own synchronization
 * policy.  In the absence of a stronger guarantee by the
 * implementation, undefined behavior may result from the invocation
 * of any method on a collection that is being mutated by another
 * thread; this includes direct invocations, passing the collection to
 * a method that might perform invocations, and using an existing
 * iterator to examine the collection.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in
 * terms of the {@link Object#equals(Object) equals} method.  For example,
 * the specification for the {@link #contains(Object) contains(Object o)}
 * method says: &quot;returns &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; if and only if this collection
 * contains at least one element &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt; such that
 * &lt;tt&gt;(o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e))&lt;/tt&gt;.&quot;  This specification should
 * &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be construed to imply that invoking &lt;tt&gt;Collection.contains&lt;/tt&gt;
 * with a non-null argument &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt; will cause &lt;tt&gt;o.equals(e)&lt;/tt&gt; to be
 * invoked for any element &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;.  Implementations are free to implement
 * optimizations whereby the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; invocation is avoided, for
 * example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two elements.  (The
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} specification guarantees that two objects with
 * unequal hash codes cannot be equal.)  More generally, implementations of
 * the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
 * the specified behavior of underlying {@link Object} methods wherever the
 * implementor deems it appropriate.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Some collection operations which perform recursive traversal of the
 * collection may fail with an exception for self-referential instances where
 * the collection directly or indirectly contains itself. This includes the
 * {@code clone()}, {@code equals()}, {@code hashCode()} and {@code toString()}
 * methods. Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario,
 * however most current implementations do not do so.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface is a member of the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html&quot;&gt;
 * Java Collections Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * The default method implementations (inherited or otherwise) do not apply any
 * synchronization protocol.  If a {@code Collection} implementation has a
 * specific synchronization protocol, then it must override default
 * implementations to apply that protocol.

     * operation.
