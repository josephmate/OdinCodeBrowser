/**
 * A collection that contains no duplicate elements.  More formally, sets
 * contain no pair of elements &lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt; such that
 * &lt;code&gt;e1.equals(e2)&lt;/code&gt;, and at most one null element.  As implied by
 * its name, this interface models the mathematical &lt;i&gt;set&lt;/i&gt; abstraction.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;Set&lt;/tt&gt; interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 * inherited from the &lt;tt&gt;Collection&lt;/tt&gt; interface, on the contracts of all
 * constructors and on the contracts of the &lt;tt&gt;add&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; and
 * &lt;tt&gt;hashCode&lt;/tt&gt; methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 * also included here for convenience.  (The specifications accompanying these
 * declarations have been tailored to the &lt;tt&gt;Set&lt;/tt&gt; interface, but they do
 * not contain any additional stipulations.)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
 * that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
 * (as defined above).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
 * elements.  The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
 * is changed in a manner that affects &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; comparisons while the
 * object is an element in the set.  A special case of this prohibition is
 * that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * &lt;tt&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/tt&gt;.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as &quot;optional&quot; in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface is a member of the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html&quot;&gt;
 * Java Collections Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
