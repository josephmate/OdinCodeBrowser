/**
 * &lt;code&gt;PropertyResourceBundle&lt;/code&gt; is a concrete subclass of
 * &lt;code&gt;ResourceBundle&lt;/code&gt; that manages resources for a locale
 * using a set of static strings from a property file. See
 * {@link ResourceBundle ResourceBundle} for more information about resource
 * bundles.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Unlike other types of resource bundle, you don't subclass
 * &lt;code&gt;PropertyResourceBundle&lt;/code&gt;.  Instead, you supply properties
 * files containing the resource data.  &lt;code&gt;ResourceBundle.getBundle&lt;/code&gt;
 * will automatically look for the appropriate properties file and create a
 * &lt;code&gt;PropertyResourceBundle&lt;/code&gt; that refers to it. See
 * {@link ResourceBundle#getBundle(java.lang.String, java.util.Locale, java.lang.ClassLoader) ResourceBundle.getBundle}
 * for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The following &lt;a name=&quot;sample&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; shows a member of a resource
 * bundle family with the base name &quot;MyResources&quot;.
 * The text defines the bundle &quot;MyResources_de&quot;,
 * the German member of the bundle family.
 * This member is based on &lt;code&gt;PropertyResourceBundle&lt;/code&gt;, and the text
 * therefore is the content of the file &quot;MyResources_de.properties&quot;
 * (a related &lt;a href=&quot;ListResourceBundle.html#sample&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; shows
 * how you can add bundles to this family that are implemented as subclasses
 * of &lt;code&gt;ListResourceBundle&lt;/code&gt;).
 * The keys in this example are of the form &quot;s1&quot; etc. The actual
 * keys are entirely up to your choice, so long as they are the same as
 * the keys you use in your program to retrieve the objects from the bundle.
 * Keys are case-sensitive.
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * # MessageFormat pattern
 * s1=Die Platte \&quot;{1}\&quot; enth&amp;auml;lt {0}.
 *
 * # location of {0} in pattern
 * s2=1
 *
 * # sample disk name
 * s3=Meine Platte
 *
 * # first ChoiceFormat choice
 * s4=keine Dateien
 *
 * # second ChoiceFormat choice
 * s5=eine Datei
 *
 * # third ChoiceFormat choice
 * s6={0,number} Dateien
 *
 * # sample date
 * s7=3. M&amp;auml;rz 1996
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The implementation of a {@code PropertyResourceBundle} subclass must be
 * thread-safe if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default
 * implementations of the non-abstract methods in this class are thread-safe.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; PropertyResourceBundle can be constructed either
 * from an InputStream or a Reader, which represents a property file.
 * Constructing a PropertyResourceBundle instance from an InputStream requires
 * that the input stream be encoded in ISO-8859-1.  In that case, characters
 * that cannot be represented in ISO-8859-1 encoding must be represented by Unicode Escapes
 * as defined in section 3.3 of
 * &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;
 * whereas the other constructor which takes a Reader does not have that limitation.
 *
 * @see ResourceBundle
 * @see ListResourceBundle
 * @see Properties
