/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Remote&lt;/code&gt; interface serves to identify interfaces whose
 * methods may be invoked from a non-local virtual machine.  Any object that
 * is a remote object must directly or indirectly implement this interface.
 * Only those methods specified in a &quot;remote interface&quot;, an interface that
 * extends &lt;code&gt;java.rmi.Remote&lt;/code&gt; are available remotely.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Implementation classes can implement any number of remote interfaces and
 * can extend other remote implementation classes.  RMI provides some
 * convenience classes that remote object implementations can extend which
 * facilitate remote object creation.  These classes are
 * &lt;code&gt;java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject&lt;/code&gt; and
 * &lt;code&gt;java.rmi.activation.Activatable&lt;/code&gt;.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;For complete details on RMI, see the &lt;a
 href=../../../platform/rmi/spec/rmiTOC.html&gt;RMI Specification&lt;/a&gt; which describes the RMI API and system.
