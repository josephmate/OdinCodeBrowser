/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Activator&lt;/code&gt; facilitates remote object activation. A
 * &quot;faulting&quot; remote reference calls the activator's
 * &lt;code&gt;activate&lt;/code&gt; method to obtain a &quot;live&quot; reference to a
 * &quot;activatable&quot; remote object. Upon receiving a request for activation,
 * the activator looks up the activation descriptor for the activation
 * identifier, &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, determines the group in which the
 * object should be activated initiates object re-creation via the
 * group's &lt;code&gt;ActivationInstantiator&lt;/code&gt; (via a call to the
 * &lt;code&gt;newInstance&lt;/code&gt; method). The activator initiates the
 * execution of activation groups as necessary. For example, if an
 * activation group for a specific group identifier is not already
 * executing, the activator initiates the execution of a VM for the
 * group. &lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The &lt;code&gt;Activator&lt;/code&gt; works closely with
 * &lt;code&gt;ActivationSystem&lt;/code&gt;, which provides a means for registering
 * groups and objects within those groups, and &lt;code&gt;ActivationMonitor&lt;/code&gt;,
 * which recives information about active and inactive objects and inactive
 * groups. &lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The activator is responsible for monitoring and detecting when
 * activation groups fail so that it can remove stale remote references
 * to groups and active object's within those groups.&lt;p&gt;

     * already, and &lt;code&gt;force&lt;/code&gt; is false , the stub with a
     * &quot;live&quot; reference is returned immediately to the caller;
     * otherwise, if the activator does not know that corresponding
     * the remote object is active, the activator uses the activation
     * descriptor information (previously registered) to determine the
     * group (VM) in which the object should be activated. If an

     * the activation group's &lt;code&gt;newInstance&lt;/code&gt; method passing
     * it the object's id and descriptor. &lt;p&gt;

     * If the activation group for the object's group descriptor does

     * activation request to the activation group and return the
     * result (a marshalled remote object reference, a stub) to the
     * caller.&lt;p&gt;
     *
     * Note that the activator receives a &quot;marshalled&quot; object instead of a
     * Remote object so that the activator does not need to load the
     * code for that object, or participate in distributed garbage
     * collection for that object. If the activator kept a strong
     * reference to the remote object, the activator would then
     * prevent the object from being garbage collected under the
     * normal distributed garbage collection mechanism. &lt;p&gt;

     * @param force if true, the activator contacts the group to obtain
     * the remote object's reference; if false, returning the cached value
     * is allowed.
     * @return the remote object (a stub) in a marshalled form
     * @exception ActivationException if object activation fails
     * @exception UnknownObjectException if object is unknown (not registered)
     * @exception RemoteException if remote call fails
