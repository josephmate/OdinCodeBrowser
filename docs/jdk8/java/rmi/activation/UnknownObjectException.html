/**
 * An &lt;code&gt;UnknownObjectException&lt;/code&gt; is thrown by methods of classes and
 * interfaces in the &lt;code&gt;java.rmi.activation&lt;/code&gt; package when the
 * &lt;code&gt;ActivationID&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the method is determined to be
 * invalid.  An &lt;code&gt;ActivationID&lt;/code&gt; is invalid if it is not currently
 * known by the &lt;code&gt;ActivationSystem&lt;/code&gt;.  An &lt;code&gt;ActivationID&lt;/code&gt;
 * is obtained by the &lt;code&gt;ActivationSystem.registerObject&lt;/code&gt; method.
 * An &lt;code&gt;ActivationID&lt;/code&gt; is also obtained during the
 * &lt;code&gt;Activatable.register&lt;/code&gt; call.
