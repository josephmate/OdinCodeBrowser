/**
 *
 * The representation (mapping) in the Java programming language of an SQL ROWID
 * value. An SQL ROWID is a built-in type, a value of which can be thought of as
 * an address  for its identified row in a database table. Whether that address
 * is logical or, in any  respects, physical is determined by its originating data
 * source.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Methods in the interfaces &lt;code&gt;ResultSet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CallableStatement&lt;/code&gt;,
 * and &lt;code&gt;PreparedStatement&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;getRowId&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setRowId&lt;/code&gt;
 * allow a programmer to access a SQL &lt;code&gt;ROWID&lt;/code&gt;  value. The &lt;code&gt;RowId&lt;/code&gt;
 * interface provides a method
 * for representing the value of the &lt;code&gt;ROWID&lt;/code&gt; as a byte array or as a
 * &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The method &lt;code&gt;getRowIdLifetime&lt;/code&gt; in the interface &lt;code&gt;DatabaseMetaData&lt;/code&gt;,
 * can be used
 * to determine if a &lt;code&gt;RowId&lt;/code&gt; object remains valid for the duration of the transaction in
 * which  the &lt;code&gt;RowId&lt;/code&gt; was created, the duration of the session in which
 * the &lt;code&gt;RowId&lt;/code&gt; was created,
 * or, effectively, for as long as its identified row is not deleted. In addition
 * to specifying the duration of its valid lifetime outside its originating data
 * source, &lt;code&gt;getRowIdLifetime&lt;/code&gt; specifies the duration of a &lt;code&gt;ROWID&lt;/code&gt;
 * value's valid lifetime
 * within its originating data source. In this, it differs from a large object,
 * because there is no limit on the valid lifetime of a large  object within its
 * originating data source.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * All methods on the &lt;code&gt;RowId&lt;/code&gt; interface must be fully implemented if the
 * JDBC driver supports the data type.
 *
 * @see java.sql.DatabaseMetaData
