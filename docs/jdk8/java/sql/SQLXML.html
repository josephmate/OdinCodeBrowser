/**
 * The mapping in the JavaTM programming language for the SQL XML type.
 * XML is a built-in type that stores an XML value
 * as a column value in a row of a database table.
 * By default drivers implement an SQLXML object as
 * a logical pointer to the XML data
 * rather than the data itself.
 * An SQLXML object is valid for the duration of the transaction in which it was created.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The SQLXML interface provides methods for accessing the XML value
 * as a String, a Reader or Writer, or as a Stream.  The XML value
 * may also be accessed through a Source or set as a Result, which
 * are used with XML Parser APIs such as DOM, SAX, and StAX, as
 * well as with XSLT transforms and XPath evaluations.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Methods in the interfaces ResultSet, CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement,
 * such as getSQLXML allow a programmer to access an XML value.
 * In addition, this interface has methods for updating an XML value.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The XML value of the SQLXML instance may be obtained as a BinaryStream using
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   SQLXML sqlxml = resultSet.getSQLXML(column);
 *   InputStream binaryStream = sqlxml.getBinaryStream();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * For example, to parse an XML value with a DOM parser:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   DocumentBuilder parser = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder();
 *   Document result = parser.parse(binaryStream);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or to parse an XML value with a SAX parser to your handler:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   SAXParser parser = SAXParserFactory.newInstance().newSAXParser();
 *   parser.parse(binaryStream, myHandler);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or to parse an XML value with a StAX parser:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
 *   XMLStreamReader streamReader = factory.createXMLStreamReader(binaryStream);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Because databases may use an optimized representation for the XML,
 * accessing the value through getSource() and
 * setResult() can lead to improved processing performance
 * without serializing to a stream representation and parsing the XML.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For example, to obtain a DOM Document Node:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   DOMSource domSource = sqlxml.getSource(DOMSource.class);
 *   Document document = (Document) domSource.getNode();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or to set the value to a DOM Document Node to myNode:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   DOMResult domResult = sqlxml.setResult(DOMResult.class);
 *   domResult.setNode(myNode);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or, to send SAX events to your handler:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   SAXSource saxSource = sqlxml.getSource(SAXSource.class);
 *   XMLReader xmlReader = saxSource.getXMLReader();
 *   xmlReader.setContentHandler(myHandler);
 *   xmlReader.parse(saxSource.getInputSource());
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or, to set the result value from SAX events:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   SAXResult saxResult = sqlxml.setResult(SAXResult.class);
 *   ContentHandler contentHandler = saxResult.getHandler();
 *   contentHandler.startDocument();
 *   // set the XML elements and attributes into the result
 *   contentHandler.endDocument();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or, to obtain StAX events:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   StAXSource staxSource = sqlxml.getSource(StAXSource.class);
 *   XMLStreamReader streamReader = staxSource.getXMLStreamReader();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or, to set the result value from StAX events:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   StAXResult staxResult = sqlxml.setResult(StAXResult.class);
 *   XMLStreamWriter streamWriter = staxResult.getXMLStreamWriter();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or, to perform XSLT transformations on the XML value using the XSLT in xsltFile
 * output to file resultFile:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   File xsltFile = new File(&quot;a.xslt&quot;);
 *   File myFile = new File(&quot;result.xml&quot;);
 *   Transformer xslt = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsltFile));
 *   Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
 *   Result result = new StreamResult(myFile);
 *   xslt.transform(source, result);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * or, to evaluate an XPath expression on the XML value:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
 *   DOMSource domSource = sqlxml.getSource(DOMSource.class);
 *   Document document = (Document) domSource.getNode();
 *   String expression = &quot;/foo/@bar&quot;;
 *   String barValue = xpath.evaluate(expression, document);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * To set the XML value to be the result of an XSLT transform:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   File sourceFile = new File(&quot;source.xml&quot;);
 *   Transformer xslt = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsltFile));
 *   Source streamSource = new StreamSource(sourceFile);
 *   Result result = sqlxml.setResult(null);
 *   xslt.transform(streamSource, result);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * Any Source can be transformed to a Result using the identity transform
 * specified by calling newTransformer():
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   Transformer identity = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();
 *   Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
 *   File myFile = new File(&quot;result.xml&quot;);
 *   Result result = new StreamResult(myFile);
 *   identity.transform(source, result);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * To write the contents of a Source to standard output:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   Transformer identity = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();
 *   Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
 *   Result result = new StreamResult(System.out);
 *   identity.transform(source, result);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * To create a DOMSource from a DOMResult:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *    DOMSource domSource = new DOMSource(domResult.getNode());
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Incomplete or invalid XML values may cause an SQLException when
 * set or the exception may occur when execute() occurs.  All streams
 * must be closed before execute() occurs or an SQLException will be thrown.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Reading and writing XML values to or from an SQLXML object can happen at most once.
 * The conceptual states of readable and not readable determine if one
 * of the reading APIs will return a value or throw an exception.
 * The conceptual states of writable and not writable determine if one
 * of the writing APIs will set a value or throw an exception.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The state moves from readable to not readable once free() or any of the
 * reading APIs are called: getBinaryStream(), getCharacterStream(), getSource(), and getString().
 * Implementations may also change the state to not writable when this occurs.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The state moves from writable to not writeable once free() or any of the
 * writing APIs are called: setBinaryStream(), setCharacterStream(), setResult(), and setString().
 * Implementations may also change the state to not readable when this occurs.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * All methods on the &lt;code&gt;SQLXML&lt;/code&gt; interface must be fully implemented if the
 * JDBC driver supports the data type.
