/**
 * The interface that every driver class must implement.
 * &lt;P&gt;The Java SQL framework allows for multiple database drivers.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;Each driver should supply a class that implements
 * the Driver interface.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;The DriverManager will try to load as many drivers as it can
 * find and then for any given connection request, it will ask each
 * driver in turn to try to connect to the target URL.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;It is strongly recommended that each Driver class should be
 * small and standalone so that the Driver class can be loaded and
 * queried without bringing in vast quantities of supporting code.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;When a Driver class is loaded, it should create an instance of
 * itself and register it with the DriverManager. This means that a
 * user can load and register a driver by calling:
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@code Class.forName(&quot;foo.bah.Driver&quot;)}
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A JDBC driver may create a {@linkplain DriverAction} implementation in order
 * to receive notifications when {@linkplain DriverManager#deregisterDriver} has
 * been called.
 * @see DriverManager
 * @see Connection
 * @see DriverAction
