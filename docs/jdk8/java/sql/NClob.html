/**
 * The mapping in the Java&amp;trade; programming language
 * for the SQL &lt;code&gt;NCLOB&lt;/code&gt; type.
 * An SQL &lt;code&gt;NCLOB&lt;/code&gt; is a built-in type
 * that stores a Character Large Object using the National Character Set
 *  as a column value in a row of  a database table.
 * &lt;P&gt;The &lt;code&gt;NClob&lt;/code&gt; interface extends the &lt;code&gt;Clob&lt;/code&gt; interface
 * which provides provides methods for getting the
 * length of an SQL &lt;code&gt;NCLOB&lt;/code&gt; value,
 * for materializing a &lt;code&gt;NCLOB&lt;/code&gt; value on the client, and for
 * searching for a substring or &lt;code&gt;NCLOB&lt;/code&gt; object within a
 * &lt;code&gt;NCLOB&lt;/code&gt; value. A &lt;code&gt;NClob&lt;/code&gt; object, just like a &lt;code&gt;Clob&lt;/code&gt; object, is valid for the duration
 * of the transaction in which it was created.
 * Methods in the interfaces {@link ResultSet},
 * {@link CallableStatement}, and {@link PreparedStatement}, such as
 * &lt;code&gt;getNClob&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setNClob&lt;/code&gt; allow a programmer to
 * access an SQL &lt;code&gt;NCLOB&lt;/code&gt; value.  In addition, this interface
 * has methods for updating a &lt;code&gt;NCLOB&lt;/code&gt; value.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * All methods on the &lt;code&gt;NClob&lt;/code&gt; interface must be fully implemented if the
 * JDBC driver supports the data type.
 *
 * @since 1.6
