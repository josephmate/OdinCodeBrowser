/**
 * The interface used for the custom mapping of an SQL user-defined type (UDT) to
 * a class in the Java programming language. The class object for a class
 * implementing the &lt;code&gt;SQLData&lt;/code&gt; interface will be entered in the
 * appropriate &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; object's type map along with the SQL
 * name of the UDT for which it is a custom mapping.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Typically, a &lt;code&gt;SQLData&lt;/code&gt; implementation
 * will define a field for each attribute of an SQL structured type or a
 * single field for an SQL &lt;code&gt;DISTINCT&lt;/code&gt; type. When the UDT is
 * retrieved from a data source with the &lt;code&gt;ResultSet.getObject&lt;/code&gt;
 * method, it will be mapped as an instance of this class.  A programmer
 * can operate on this class instance just as on any other object in the
 * Java programming language and then store any changes made to it by
 * calling the &lt;code&gt;PreparedStatement.setObject&lt;/code&gt; method,
 * which will map it back to the SQL type.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * It is expected that the implementation of the class for a custom
 * mapping will be done by a tool.  In a typical implementation, the
 * programmer would simply supply the name of the SQL UDT, the name of
 * the class to which it is being mapped, and the names of the fields to
 * which each of the attributes of the UDT is to be mapped.  The tool will use
 * this information to implement the &lt;code&gt;SQLData.readSQL&lt;/code&gt; and
 * &lt;code&gt;SQLData.writeSQL&lt;/code&gt; methods.  The &lt;code&gt;readSQL&lt;/code&gt; method
 * calls the appropriate &lt;code&gt;SQLInput&lt;/code&gt; methods to read
 * each attribute from an &lt;code&gt;SQLInput&lt;/code&gt; object, and the
 * &lt;code&gt;writeSQL&lt;/code&gt; method calls &lt;code&gt;SQLOutput&lt;/code&gt; methods
 * to write each attribute back to the data source via an
 * &lt;code&gt;SQLOutput&lt;/code&gt; object.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * An application programmer will not normally call &lt;code&gt;SQLData&lt;/code&gt; methods
 * directly, and the &lt;code&gt;SQLInput&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SQLOutput&lt;/code&gt; methods
 * are called internally by &lt;code&gt;SQLData&lt;/code&gt; methods, not by application code.
