/**
 * An {@code AttributedCharacterIterator} allows iteration through both text and
 * related attribute information.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An attribute is a key/value pair, identified by the key.  No two
 * attributes on a given character can have the same key.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The values for an attribute are immutable, or must not be mutated
 * by clients or storage.  They are always passed by reference, and not
 * cloned.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;run with respect to an attribute&lt;/em&gt; is a maximum text range for
 * which:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;the attribute is undefined or {@code null} for the entire range, or
 * &lt;li&gt;the attribute value is defined and has the same non-{@code null} value for the
 *     entire range.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;run with respect to a set of attributes&lt;/em&gt; is a maximum text range for
 * which this condition is met for each member attribute.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;When getting a run with no explicit attributes specified (i.e.,
 * calling {@link #getRunStart()} and {@link #getRunLimit()}), any
 * contiguous text segments having the same attributes (the same set
 * of attribute/value pairs) are treated as separate runs if the
 * attributes have been given to those text segments separately.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The returned indexes are limited to the range of the iterator.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The returned attribute information is limited to runs that contain
 * the current character.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Attribute keys are instances of {@link AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute} and its
 * subclasses, such as {@link java.awt.font.TextAttribute}.
 *
 * @see AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
 * @see java.awt.font.TextAttribute
