/**
 * A &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt; represents a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; under the
 * rules of a specific &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt; object. Comparing two
 * &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s returns the relative order of the
 * &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s they represent. Using &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s
 * to compare &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s is generally faster than using
 * &lt;code&gt;Collator.compare&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, when the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s
 * must be compared multiple times, for example when sorting a list
 * of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s. It's more efficient to use &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * You can not create &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s directly. Rather,
 * generate them by calling &lt;code&gt;Collator.getCollationKey&lt;/code&gt;.
 * You can only compare &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s generated from
 * the same &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt; object.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Generating a &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;
 * involves examining the entire &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;
 * and converting it to series of bits that can be compared bitwise. This
 * allows fast comparisons once the keys are generated. The cost of generating
 * keys is recouped in faster comparisons when &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s need
 * to be compared many times. On the other hand, the result of a comparison
 * is often determined by the first couple of characters of each &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;code&gt;Collator.compare&lt;/code&gt; examines only as many characters as it needs which
 * allows it to be faster when doing single comparisons.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The following example shows how &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s might be used
 * to sort a list of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s.
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // Create an array of CollationKeys for the Strings to be sorted.
 * Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
 * CollationKey[] keys = new CollationKey[3];
 * keys[0] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Tom&quot;);
 * keys[1] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Dick&quot;);
 * keys[2] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Harry&quot;);
 * sort(keys);
 *
 * //...
 *
 * // Inside body of sort routine, compare keys this way
 * if (keys[i].compareTo(keys[j]) &gt; 0)
 *    // swap keys[i] and keys[j]
 *
 * //...
 *
 * // Finally, when we've returned from sort.
 * System.out.println(keys[0].getSourceString());
 * System.out.println(keys[1].getSourceString());
 * System.out.println(keys[2].getSourceString());
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
