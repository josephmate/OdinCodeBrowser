/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt; class performs locale-sensitive
 * &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; comparison. You use this class to build
 * searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt; is an abstract base class. Subclasses
 * implement specific collation strategies. One subclass,
 * &lt;code&gt;RuleBasedCollator&lt;/code&gt;, is currently provided with
 * the Java Platform and is applicable to a wide set of languages. Other
 * subclasses may be created to handle more specialized needs.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Like other locale-sensitive classes, you can use the static
 * factory method, &lt;code&gt;getInstance&lt;/code&gt;, to obtain the appropriate
 * &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt; object for a given locale. You will only need
 * to look at the subclasses of &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt; if you need
 * to understand the details of a particular collation strategy or
 * if you need to modify that strategy.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The following example shows how to compare two strings using
 * the &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt; for the default locale.
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // Compare two strings in the default locale
 * Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
 * if( myCollator.compare(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;) &lt; 0 )
 *     System.out.println(&quot;abc is less than ABC&quot;);
 * else
 *     System.out.println(&quot;abc is greater than or equal to ABC&quot;);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * You can set a &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; property
 * to determine the level of difference considered significant in
 * comparisons. Four strengths are provided: &lt;code&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/code&gt;,
 * &lt;code&gt;SECONDARY&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TERTIARY&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;IDENTICAL&lt;/code&gt;.
 * The exact assignment of strengths to language features is
 * locale dependant.  For example, in Czech, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;f&quot; are considered
 * primary differences, while &quot;e&quot; and &quot;&amp;#283;&quot; are secondary differences,
 * &quot;e&quot; and &quot;E&quot; are tertiary differences and &quot;e&quot; and &quot;e&quot; are identical.
 * The following shows how both case and accents could be ignored for
 * US English.
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY
 * Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);
 * usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
 * if( usCollator.compare(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;) == 0 ) {
 *     System.out.println(&quot;Strings are equivalent&quot;);
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For comparing &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s exactly once, the &lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt;
 * method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of
 * &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s however, it is generally necessary to compare each
 * &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; multiple times. In this case, &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s
 * provide better performance. The &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt; class converts
 * a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; to a series of bits that can be compared bitwise
 * against other &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s. A &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt; is
 * created by a &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt; object for a given &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;br&gt;
 * &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s from different
 * &lt;code&gt;Collator&lt;/code&gt;s can not be compared. See the class description
 * for {@link CollationKey}
 * for an example using &lt;code&gt;CollationKey&lt;/code&gt;s.
