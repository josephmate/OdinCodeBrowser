/**
 * The PersistenceDelegate class takes the responsibility
 * for expressing the state of an instance of a given class
 * in terms of the methods in the class's public API. Instead
 * of associating the responsibility of persistence with
 * the class itself as is done, for example, by the
 * &lt;code&gt;readObject&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;writeObject&lt;/code&gt;
 * methods used by the &lt;code&gt;ObjectOutputStream&lt;/code&gt;, streams like
 * the &lt;code&gt;XMLEncoder&lt;/code&gt; which
 * use this delegation model can have their behavior controlled
 * independently of the classes themselves. Normally, the class
 * is the best place to put such information and conventions
 * can easily be expressed in this delegation scheme to do just that.
 * Sometimes however, it is the case that a minor problem
 * in a single class prevents an entire object graph from
 * being written and this can leave the application
 * developer with no recourse but to attempt to shadow
 * the problematic classes locally or use alternative
 * persistence techniques. In situations like these, the
 * delegation model gives a relatively clean mechanism for
 * the application developer to intervene in all parts of the
 * serialization process without requiring that modifications
 * be made to the implementation of classes which are not part
 * of the application itself.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In addition to using a delegation model, this persistence
 * scheme differs from traditional serialization schemes
 * in requiring an analog of the &lt;code&gt;writeObject&lt;/code&gt;
 * method without a corresponding &lt;code&gt;readObject&lt;/code&gt;
 * method. The &lt;code&gt;writeObject&lt;/code&gt; analog encodes each
 * instance in terms of its public API and there is no need to
 * define a &lt;code&gt;readObject&lt;/code&gt; analog
 * since the procedure for reading the serialized form
 * is defined by the semantics of method invocation as laid
 * out in the Java Language Specification.
 * Breaking the dependency between &lt;code&gt;writeObject&lt;/code&gt;
 * and &lt;code&gt;readObject&lt;/code&gt; implementations, which may
 * change from version to version, is the key factor
 * in making the archives produced by this technique immune
 * to changes in the private implementations of the classes
 * to which they refer.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A persistence delegate, may take control of all
 * aspects of the persistence of an object including:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;
 * Deciding whether or not an instance can be mutated
 * into another instance of the same class.
 * &lt;li&gt;
 * Instantiating the object, either by calling a
 * public constructor or a public factory method.
 * &lt;li&gt;
 * Performing the initialization of the object.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
