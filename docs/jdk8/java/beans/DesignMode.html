 * The JavaBeans&amp;trade; specification defines the notion of design time as is a
 * mode in which JavaBeans instances should function during their composition
 * and customization in a interactive design, composition or construction tool,
 * as opposed to runtime when the JavaBean is part of an applet, application,
 * or other live Java executable abstraction.
