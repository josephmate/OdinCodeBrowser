/**
 * Framework-level interface defining read-write access to a temporal object,
 * such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects that
 * are complete enough to be manipulated using plus and minus.
 * It is implemented by those classes that can provide and manipulate information
 * as {@linkplain TemporalField fields} or {@linkplain TemporalQuery queries}.
 * See {@link TemporalAccessor} for the read-only version of this interface.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
 * These are modeled using {@code TemporalField} with the number held using
 * a {@code long} to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
 * simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
 * See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
 * the {@linkplain java.time.chrono.Chronology chronology} and the
 * {@linkplain java.time.ZoneId time-zone}.
 * These can be accessed via {@link #query(TemporalQuery) queries} using
 * the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQuery}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
 * used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
 * around instances of concrete types, such as {@code LocalDate}.
 * There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
 * of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
 * See {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;When to implement&lt;/h3&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per {@code TemporalAccessor}
 * &lt;li&gt;the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest
 * &lt;li&gt;the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
 *  valid range of values for the fields that are represented
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Four examples make this clear:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@code LocalDate} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
 *  that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
 *  the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.
 * &lt;li&gt;{@code LocalTime} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
 *  that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
 *  validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.
 * &lt;li&gt;{@code MonthDay}, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement
 *  this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,
 *  the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values
 *  for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.
 * &lt;li&gt;The combination day-of-week and day-of-month (&quot;Friday the 13th&quot;) should not implement
 *  this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps
 *  days to months.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
 * however immutability is strongly recommended.
 * All implementations must be {@link Comparable}.
 *
 * @since 1.8

     * &lt;p&gt;
     * For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
     * be calculated:
     * &lt;pre&gt;

     * @implSpec
     * Implementations must begin by checking to ensure that the input temporal
     * object is of the same observable type as the implementation.
     * They must then perform the calculation for all instances of {@link ChronoUnit}.
     * An {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown for {@code ChronoUnit}
     * instances that are unsupported.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
     * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
     * the second argument.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * In summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *  // convert the end temporal to the same type as this class
     *  if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {
     *    // if unit is supported, then calculate and return result
     *    // else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units
     *  }
     *  return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Note that the unit's {@code between} method must only be invoked if the
     * two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by {@code getClass()}.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
     * read-only method is invoked.
