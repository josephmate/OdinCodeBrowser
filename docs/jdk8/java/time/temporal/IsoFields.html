/**
 * Fields and units specific to the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 * including quarter-of-year and week-based-year.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class defines fields and units that are specific to the ISO calendar system.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Quarter of year&lt;/h3&gt;
 * The ISO-8601 standard is based on the standard civic 12 month year.
 * This is commonly divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * January, February and March are in Q1.
 * April, May and June are in Q2.
 * July, August and September are in Q3.
 * October, November and December are in Q4.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The complete date is expressed using three fields:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #DAY_OF_QUARTER DAY_OF_QUARTER} - the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #QUARTER_OF_YEAR QUARTER_OF_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} - the standard ISO year
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Week based years&lt;/h3&gt;
 * The ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format,
 * defining a string format for dates and times. However, it also defines an
 * alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The date is expressed using three fields:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK DAY_OF_WEEK} - the standard field defining the
 *  day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7)
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year
 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #WEEK_BASED_YEAR WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week-based-year
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year.
 * It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard
 * ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st
 * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year
 * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year
 * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year
 * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th
 * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd
 * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * There are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For example:
 *
 * &lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left; width: 50%;&quot;&gt;
 * &lt;caption&gt;Examples of Week based Years&lt;/caption&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Day-of-week&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Field values&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2008-12-28&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sunday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 52 of week-based-year 2008&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2008-12-29&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Monday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2008-12-31&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wednesday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-01&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Thursday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-04&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sunday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-05&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Monday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 2 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
