/**
 * Common and useful TemporalAdjusters.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects.
 * They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different
 * approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
 * Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that
 * sets the date to the last day of the month.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code TemporalAdjuster}.
 * The first is to invoke the method on the interface directly.
 * The second is to use {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *   temporal = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal);
 *   temporal = temporal.with(thisAdjuster);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code with(TemporalAdjuster)},
 * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class contains a standard set of adjusters, available as static methods.
 * These include:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;finding the first or last day of the month
 * &lt;li&gt;finding the first day of next month
 * &lt;li&gt;finding the first or last day of the year
 * &lt;li&gt;finding the first day of next year
 * &lt;li&gt;finding the first or last day-of-week within a month, such as &quot;first Wednesday in June&quot;
 * &lt;li&gt;finding the next or previous day-of-week, such as &quot;next Thursday&quot;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * @implSpec
 * All the implementations supplied by the static methods are immutable.
 *
 * @see TemporalAdjuster
 * @since 1.8

     * Returns the previous-or-same day-of-week adjuster, which adjusts the date to the
     * first occurrence of the specified day-of-week before the date being adjusted
     * unless it is already on that day in which case the same object is returned.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:&lt;br&gt;
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (MONDAY) will return 2011-01-10 (five days earlier).&lt;br&gt;
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (WEDNESDAY) will return 2011-01-12 (three days earlier).&lt;br&gt;
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (SATURDAY) will return 2011-01-15 (same as input).
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
     * It uses the {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} field and the {@code DAYS} unit,
     * and assumes a seven day week.
     *
     * @param dayOfWeek  the day-of-week to check for or move the date to, not null
     * @return the previous-or-same day-of-week adjuster, not null
