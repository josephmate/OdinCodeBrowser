 * An era of the time-line.

 * Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
 * However, some calendar systems, have multiple eras, such as one for the reign
 * of each leader.
 * In all cases, the era is conceptually the largest division of the time-line.
 * Each chronology defines the Era's that are known Eras and a
 * {@link Chronology#eras Chronology.eras} to get the valid eras.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For example, the Thai Buddhist calendar system divides time into two eras,
 * before and after a single date. By contrast, the Japanese calendar system
 * has one era for the reign of each Emperor.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Instances of {@code Era} may be compared using the {@code ==} operator.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations must be singletons - final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * It is recommended to use an enum whenever possible.
