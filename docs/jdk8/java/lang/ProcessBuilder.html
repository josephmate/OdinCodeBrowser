/**
 * This class is used to create operating system processes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Each {@code ProcessBuilder} instance manages a collection
 * of process attributes.  The {@link #start()} method creates a new
 * {@link Process} instance with those attributes.  The {@link
 * #start()} method can be invoked repeatedly from the same instance
 * to create new subprocesses with identical or related attributes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Each process builder manages these process attributes:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;a &lt;i&gt;command&lt;/i&gt;, a list of strings which signifies the
 * external program file to be invoked and its arguments, if any.
 * Which string lists represent a valid operating system command is
 * system-dependent.  For example, it is common for each conceptual
 * argument to be an element in this list, but there are operating
 * systems where programs are expected to tokenize command line
 * strings themselves - on such a system a Java implementation might
 * require commands to contain exactly two elements.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;an &lt;i&gt;environment&lt;/i&gt;, which is a system-dependent mapping from
 * &lt;i&gt;variables&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;values&lt;/i&gt;.  The initial value is a copy of
 * the environment of the current process (see {@link System#getenv()}).
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;a &lt;i&gt;working directory&lt;/i&gt;.  The default value is the current
 * working directory of the current process, usually the directory
 * named by the system property {@code user.dir}.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;redirect-input&quot;&gt;a source of &lt;i&gt;standard input&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 * By default, the subprocess reads input from a pipe.  Java code
 * can access this pipe via the output stream returned by
 * {@link Process#getOutputStream()}.  However, standard input may
 * be redirected to another source using
 * {@link #redirectInput(Redirect) redirectInput}.
 * In this case, {@link Process#getOutputStream()} will return a
 * &lt;i&gt;null output stream&lt;/i&gt;, for which:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;the {@link OutputStream#write(int) write} methods always
 * throw {@code IOException}
 * &lt;li&gt;the {@link OutputStream#close() close} method does nothing
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;redirect-output&quot;&gt;a destination for &lt;i&gt;standard output&lt;/i&gt;
 * and &lt;i&gt;standard error&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  By default, the subprocess writes standard
 * output and standard error to pipes.  Java code can access these pipes
 * via the input streams returned by {@link Process#getInputStream()} and
 * {@link Process#getErrorStream()}.  However, standard output and
 * standard error may be redirected to other destinations using
 * {@link #redirectOutput(Redirect) redirectOutput} and
 * {@link #redirectError(Redirect) redirectError}.
 * In this case, {@link Process#getInputStream()} and/or
 * {@link Process#getErrorStream()} will return a &lt;i&gt;null input
 * stream&lt;/i&gt;, for which:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;the {@link InputStream#read() read} methods always return
 * {@code -1}
 * &lt;li&gt;the {@link InputStream#available() available} method always returns
 * {@code 0}
 * &lt;li&gt;the {@link InputStream#close() close} method does nothing
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;a &lt;i&gt;redirectErrorStream&lt;/i&gt; property.  Initially, this property
 * is {@code false}, meaning that the standard output and error
 * output of a subprocess are sent to two separate streams, which can
 * be accessed using the {@link Process#getInputStream()} and {@link
 * Process#getErrorStream()} methods.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;If the value is set to {@code true}, then:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;standard error is merged with the standard output and always sent
 * to the same destination (this makes it easier to correlate error
 * messages with the corresponding output)
 * &lt;li&gt;the common destination of standard error and standard output can be
 * redirected using
 * {@link #redirectOutput(Redirect) redirectOutput}
 * &lt;li&gt;any redirection set by the
 * {@link #redirectError(Redirect) redirectError}
 * method is ignored when creating a subprocess
 * &lt;li&gt;the stream returned from {@link Process#getErrorStream()} will
 * always be a &lt;a href=&quot;#redirect-output&quot;&gt;null input stream&lt;/a&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes
 * subsequently started by that object's {@link #start()} method, but
 * will never affect previously started processes or the Java process
 * itself.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Most error checking is performed by the {@link #start()} method.
 * It is possible to modify the state of an object so that {@link
 * #start()} will fail.  For example, setting the command attribute to
 * an empty list will not throw an exception unless {@link #start()}
 * is invoked.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that this class is not synchronized.&lt;/strong&gt;
 * If multiple threads access a {@code ProcessBuilder} instance
 * concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies one of the
 * attributes structurally, it &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be synchronized externally.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Starting a new process which uses the default working directory
 * and environment is easy:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * Process p = new ProcessBuilder(&quot;myCommand&quot;, &quot;myArg&quot;).start();
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working
 * directory and environment, and redirects standard output and error
 * to be appended to a log file:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 * ProcessBuilder pb =
 *   new ProcessBuilder(&quot;myCommand&quot;, &quot;myArg1&quot;, &quot;myArg2&quot;);
 * Map&lt;String, String&gt; env = pb.environment();
 * env.put(&quot;VAR1&quot;, &quot;myValue&quot;);
 * env.remove(&quot;OTHERVAR&quot;);
 * env.put(&quot;VAR2&quot;, env.get(&quot;VAR1&quot;) + &quot;suffix&quot;);
 * pb.directory(new File(&quot;myDir&quot;));
 * File log = new File(&quot;log&quot;);
 * pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
 * pb.redirectOutput(Redirect.appendTo(log));
 * Process p = pb.start();
 * assert pb.redirectInput() == Redirect.PIPE;
 * assert pb.redirectOutput().file() == log;
 * assert p.getInputStream().read() == -1;
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To start a process with an explicit set of environment
 * variables, first call {@link java.util.Map#clear() Map.clear()}
 * before adding environment variables.
