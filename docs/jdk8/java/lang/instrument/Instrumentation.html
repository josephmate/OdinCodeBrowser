/**
 * This class provides services needed to instrument Java
 * programming language code.
 * Instrumentation is the addition of byte-codes to methods for the
 * purpose of gathering data to be utilized by tools.
 * Since the changes are purely additive, these tools do not modify
 * application state or behavior.
 * Examples of such benign tools include monitoring agents, profilers,
 * coverage analyzers, and event loggers.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * There are two ways to obtain an instance of the
 * &lt;code&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/code&gt; interface:
 *
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a JVM is launched in a way that indicates an agent
 *     class. In that case an &lt;code&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/code&gt; instance
 *     is passed to the &lt;code&gt;premain&lt;/code&gt; method of the agent class.
 *     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a JVM provides a mechanism to start agents sometime
 *     after the JVM is launched. In that case an &lt;code&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/code&gt;
 *     instance is passed to the &lt;code&gt;agentmain&lt;/code&gt; method of the
 *     agent code. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * These mechanisms are described in the
 * {@linkplain java.lang.instrument package specification}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Once an agent acquires an &lt;code&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/code&gt; instance,
 * the agent may call methods on the instance at any time.

    /**
     * This method modifies the failure handling of
     * native method resolution by allowing retry
     * with a prefix applied to the name.
     * When used with the
     * {@link java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer ClassFileTransformer},
     * it enables native methods to be
     * instrumented.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented
     * (they have no bytecodes), they must be wrapped with
     * a non-native method which can be instrumented.
     * For example, if we had:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *   native boolean foo(int x);&lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * We could transform the class file (with the
     * ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition
     * of the class) so that this becomes:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *   boolean foo(int x) {
     *     &lt;i&gt;... record entry to foo ...&lt;/i&gt;
     *     return wrapped_foo(x);
     *   }
     *
     *   native boolean wrapped_foo(int x);&lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Where &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; becomes a wrapper for the actual native
     * method with the appended prefix &quot;wrapped_&quot;.  Note that
     * &quot;wrapped_&quot; would be a poor choice of prefix since it
     * might conceivably form the name of an existing method
     * thus something like &quot;$$$MyAgentWrapped$$$_&quot; would be
     * better but would make these examples less readable.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native
     * method call, but now the problem becomes linking up the
     * wrapped method with the native implementation.
     * That is, the method &lt;code&gt;wrapped_foo&lt;/code&gt; needs to be
     * resolved to the native implementation of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;,
     * which might be:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *   Java_somePackage_someClass_foo(JNIEnv* env, jint x)&lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This function allows the prefix to be specified and the
     * proper resolution to occur.
     * Specifically, when the standard resolution fails, the
     * resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration.
     * There are two ways that resolution occurs, explicit
     * resolution with the JNI function &lt;code&gt;RegisterNatives&lt;/code&gt;
     * and the normal automatic resolution.  For
     * &lt;code&gt;RegisterNatives&lt;/code&gt;, the JVM will attempt this
     * association:
     * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     *   method(foo) -&gt; nativeImplementation(foo)
     * }&lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
     * the specified prefix prepended to the method name,
     * yielding the correct resolution:
     * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     *   method(wrapped_foo) -&gt; nativeImplementation(foo)
     * }&lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * For automatic resolution, the JVM will attempt:
     * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     *   method(wrapped_foo) -&gt; nativeImplementation(wrapped_foo)
     * }&lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
     * the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name,
     * yielding the correct resolution:
     * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     *   method(wrapped_foo) -&gt; nativeImplementation(foo)
     * }&lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Note that since the prefix is only used when standard
     * resolution fails, native methods can be wrapped selectively.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Since each &lt;code&gt;ClassFileTransformer&lt;/code&gt;
     * can do its own transformation of the bytecodes, more
     * than one layer of wrappers may be applied. Thus each
     * transformer needs its own prefix.  Since transformations
     * are applied in order, the prefixes, if applied, will
     * be applied in the same order
     * (see {@link #addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean) addTransformer}).
     * Thus if three transformers applied
     * wrappers, &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; might become
     * &lt;code&gt;$trans3_$trans2_$trans1_foo&lt;/code&gt;.  But if, say,
     * the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to
     * &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; it would be just
     * &lt;code&gt;$trans3_$trans1_foo&lt;/code&gt;.  To be able to
     * efficiently determine the sequence of prefixes,
     * an intermediate prefix is only applied if its non-native
     * wrapper exists.  Thus, in the last example, even though
     * &lt;code&gt;$trans1_foo&lt;/code&gt; is not a native method, the
     * &lt;code&gt;$trans1_&lt;/code&gt; prefix is applied since
     * &lt;code&gt;$trans1_foo&lt;/code&gt; exists.
     *
     * @param   transformer
     *          The ClassFileTransformer which wraps using this prefix.
     * @param   prefix
     *          The prefix to apply to wrapped native methods when
     *          retrying a failed native method resolution. If prefix
     *          is either &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; or the empty string, then
     *          failed native method resolutions are not retried for
     *          this transformer.
     * @throws java.lang.NullPointerException if passed a &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; transformer.
     * @throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the current configuration of
     *           the JVM does not allow setting a native method prefix
     *           ({@link #isNativeMethodPrefixSupported} is false).
     * @throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if the transformer is not registered
     *           (see {@link #addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean) addTransformer}).
