/**
 * The management interface for the garbage collection of
 * the Java virtual machine.  Garbage collection is the process
 * that the Java virtual machine uses to find and reclaim unreachable
 * objects to free up memory space.  A garbage collector is one type of
 * {@link MemoryManagerMXBean memory manager}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A Java virtual machine may have one or more instances of
 * the implementation class of this interface.
 * An instance implementing this interface is
 * an &lt;a href=&quot;ManagementFactory.html#MXBean&quot;&gt;MXBean&lt;/a&gt;
 * that can be obtained by calling
 * the {@link ManagementFactory#getGarbageCollectorMXBeans} method or
 * from the {@link ManagementFactory#getPlatformMBeanServer
 * platform &lt;tt&gt;MBeanServer&lt;/tt&gt;} method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;ObjectName&lt;/tt&gt; for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
 * a garbage collector within an MBeanServer is:
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 *   {@link ManagementFactory#GARBAGE_COLLECTOR_MXBEAN_DOMAIN_TYPE
 *    &lt;tt&gt;java.lang:type=GarbageCollector&lt;/tt&gt;}&lt;tt&gt;,name=&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;collector's name&lt;/i&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *
 * It can be obtained by calling the
 * {@link PlatformManagedObject#getObjectName} method.
 *
 * A platform usually includes additional platform-dependent information
 * specific to a garbage collection algorithm for monitoring.
 *
 * @see ManagementFactory#getPlatformMXBeans(Class)
 * @see MemoryMXBean
 *
 * @see &lt;a href=&quot;../../../javax/management/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;
 *      JMX Specification.&lt;/a&gt;
