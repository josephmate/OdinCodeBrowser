/**
 * The management interface for a memory manager.
 * A memory manager manages one or more memory pools of the
 * Java virtual machine.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A Java virtual machine has one or more memory managers.
 * An instance implementing this interface is
 * an &lt;a href=&quot;ManagementFactory.html#MXBean&quot;&gt;MXBean&lt;/a&gt;
 * that can be obtained by calling
 * the {@link ManagementFactory#getMemoryManagerMXBeans} method or
 * from the {@link ManagementFactory#getPlatformMBeanServer
 * platform &lt;tt&gt;MBeanServer&lt;/tt&gt;} method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;ObjectName&lt;/tt&gt; for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
 * a memory manager within an MBeanServer is:
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 *   {@link ManagementFactory#MEMORY_MANAGER_MXBEAN_DOMAIN_TYPE
 *    &lt;tt&gt;java.lang:type=MemoryManager&lt;/tt&gt;}&lt;tt&gt;,name=&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;manager's name&lt;/i&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *
 * It can be obtained by calling the
 * {@link PlatformManagedObject#getObjectName} method.
 *
 * @see ManagementFactory#getPlatformMXBeans(Class)
 * @see MemoryMXBean
 *
 * @see &lt;a href=&quot;../../../javax/management/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;
 *      JMX Specification.&lt;/a&gt;
 * @see &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#examples&quot;&gt;
