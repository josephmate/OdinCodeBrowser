 * The Permission class for reflective operations.

 * provides a summary description of what the permission allows,

 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;suppressAccessChecks&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;ability to suppress the standard Java language access checks
 *       on fields and methods in a class; allow access not only public members
 *       but also allow access to default (package) access, protected,
 *       and private members.&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This is dangerous in that information (possibly confidential) and
 *       methods normally unavailable would be accessible to malicious code.&lt;/td&gt;
 * &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;newProxyInPackage.{package name}&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;ability to create a proxy instance in the specified package of which
 *       the non-public interface that the proxy class implements.&lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;td&gt;This gives code access to classes in packages to which it normally
 *       does not have access and the dynamic proxy class is in the system
 *       protection domain. Malicious code may use these classes to
 *       help in its attempt to compromise security in the system.&lt;/td&gt;
