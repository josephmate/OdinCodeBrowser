 * Thrown when {@link java.lang.reflect.Executable#getParameters the

 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt; The number of parameters (parameter_count) is wrong for the method
 * &lt;li&gt; A constant pool index is out of bounds.
 * &lt;li&gt; A constant pool index does not refer to a UTF-8 entry
 * &lt;li&gt; A parameter's name is &quot;&quot;, or contains an illegal character
 * &lt;li&gt; The flags field contains an illegal flag (something other than
