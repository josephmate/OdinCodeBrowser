/**
 * A class implements the &lt;code&gt;Cloneable&lt;/code&gt; interface to
 * indicate to the {@link java.lang.Object#clone()} method that it
 * is legal for that method to make a
 * field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Invoking Object's clone method on an instance that does not implement the
 * &lt;code&gt;Cloneable&lt;/code&gt; interface results in the exception
 * &lt;code&gt;CloneNotSupportedException&lt;/code&gt; being thrown.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By convention, classes that implement this interface should override
 * &lt;tt&gt;Object.clone&lt;/tt&gt; (which is protected) with a public method.
 * See {@link java.lang.Object#clone()} for details on overriding this
 * method.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that this interface does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; contain the &lt;tt&gt;clone&lt;/tt&gt; method.
 * Therefore, it is not possible to clone an object merely by virtue of the
 * fact that it implements this interface.  Even if the clone method is invoked
 * reflectively, there is no guarantee that it will succeed.
