/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; interface should be implemented by any
 * class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The
 * class must define a method of no arguments called &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 * wish to execute code while they are active. For example,
 * &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by class &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt;.
 * Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not
 * yet been stopped.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In addition, &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; provides the means for a class to be
 * active while not subclassing &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt;. A class that implements
 * &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; can run without subclassing &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt;
 * by instantiating a &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt; instance and passing itself in
 * as the target.  In most cases, the &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; interface should
 * be used if you are only planning to override the &lt;code&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt;
 * method and no other &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt; methods.
 * This is important because classes should not be subclassed
 * unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental
 * behavior of the class.
