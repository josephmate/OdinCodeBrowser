/**
 * The {@code java.lang.invoke} package contains dynamic language support provided directly by
 * the Java core class libraries and virtual machine.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * As described in the Java Virtual Machine Specification,
 * certain types in this package have special relations to dynamic
 * language support in the virtual machine:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The class {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle MethodHandle} contains
 * &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandle.html#sigpoly&quot;&gt;signature polymorphic methods&lt;/a&gt;
 * which can be linked regardless of their type descriptor.
 * Normally, method linkage requires exact matching of type descriptors.
 * &lt;/li&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;The JVM bytecode format supports immediate constants of
 * the classes {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle MethodHandle} and {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodType MethodType}.
 * &lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;jvm_mods&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Summary of relevant Java Virtual Machine changes&lt;/h1&gt;
 * The following low-level information summarizes relevant parts of the
 * Java Virtual Machine specification.  For full details, please see the
 * current version of that specification.
 *
 * Each occurrence of an {@code invokedynamic} instruction is called a &lt;em&gt;dynamic call site&lt;/em&gt;.
 * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;indyinsn&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;{@code invokedynamic} instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
 * A dynamic call site is originally in an unlinked state.  In this state, there is
 * no target method for the call site to invoke.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Before the JVM can execute a dynamic call site (an {@code invokedynamic} instruction),
 * the call site must first be &lt;em&gt;linked&lt;/em&gt;.
 * Linking is accomplished by calling a &lt;em&gt;bootstrap method&lt;/em&gt;
 * which is given the static information content of the call site,
 * and which must produce a {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle method handle}
 * that gives the behavior of the call site.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each {@code invokedynamic} instruction statically specifies its own
 * bootstrap method as a constant pool reference.
 * The constant pool reference also specifies the call site's name and type descriptor,
 * just like {@code invokevirtual} and the other invoke instructions.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Linking starts with resolving the constant pool entry for the
 * bootstrap method, and resolving a {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodType MethodType} object for
 * the type descriptor of the dynamic call site.
 * This resolution process may trigger class loading.
 * It may therefore throw an error if a class fails to load.
 * This error becomes the abnormal termination of the dynamic
 * call site execution.
 * Linkage does not trigger class initialization.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The bootstrap method is invoked on at least three values:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a {@code MethodHandles.Lookup}, a lookup object on the &lt;em&gt;caller class&lt;/em&gt; in which dynamic call site occurs &lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a {@code String}, the method name mentioned in the call site &lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a {@code MethodType}, the resolved type descriptor of the call &lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;optionally, between 1 and 251 additional static arguments taken from the constant pool &lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * Invocation is as if by
 * {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle#invoke MethodHandle.invoke}.
 * The returned result must be a {@link java.lang.invoke.CallSite CallSite} (or a subclass).
 * The type of the call site's target must be exactly equal to the type
 * derived from the dynamic call site's type descriptor and passed to
 * the bootstrap method.
 * The call site then becomes permanently linked to the dynamic call site.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * As documented in the JVM specification, all failures arising from
 * the linkage of a dynamic call site are reported
 * by a {@link java.lang.BootstrapMethodError BootstrapMethodError},
 * which is thrown as the abnormal termination of the dynamic call
 * site execution.
 * If this happens, the same error will the thrown for all subsequent
 * attempts to execute the dynamic call site.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;timing of linkage&lt;/h2&gt;
 * A dynamic call site is linked just before its first execution.
 * The bootstrap method call implementing the linkage occurs within
 * a thread that is attempting a first execution.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If there are several such threads, the bootstrap method may be
 * invoked in several threads concurrently.
 * Therefore, bootstrap methods which access global application
 * data must take the usual precautions against race conditions.
 * In any case, every {@code invokedynamic} instruction is either
 * unlinked or linked to a unique {@code CallSite} object.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In an application which requires dynamic call sites with individually
 * mutable behaviors, their bootstrap methods should produce distinct
 * {@link java.lang.invoke.CallSite CallSite} objects, one for each linkage request.
 * Alternatively, an application can link a single {@code CallSite} object
 * to several {@code invokedynamic} instructions, in which case
 * a change to the target method will become visible at each of
 * the instructions.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If several threads simultaneously execute a bootstrap method for a single dynamic
 * call site, the JVM must choose one {@code CallSite} object and install it visibly to
 * all threads.  Any other bootstrap method calls are allowed to complete, but their
 * results are ignored, and their dynamic call site invocations proceed with the originally
 * chosen target object.

 * &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 * &lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt;
 * These rules do not enable the JVM to duplicate dynamic call sites,
 * or to issue &amp;ldquo;causeless&amp;rdquo; bootstrap method calls.
 * Every dynamic call site transitions at most once from unlinked to linked,
 * just before its first invocation.
 * There is no way to undo the effect of a completed bootstrap method call.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;types of bootstrap methods&lt;/h2&gt;
 * As long as each bootstrap method can be correctly invoked
 * by {@code MethodHandle.invoke}, its detailed type is arbitrary.
 * For example, the first argument could be {@code Object}
 * instead of {@code MethodHandles.Lookup}, and the return type
 * could also be {@code Object} instead of {@code CallSite}.
 * (Note that the types and number of the stacked arguments limit
 * the legal kinds of bootstrap methods to appropriately typed
 * static methods and constructors of {@code CallSite} subclasses.)
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If a given {@code invokedynamic} instruction specifies no static arguments,
 * the instruction's bootstrap method will be invoked on three arguments,
 * conveying the instruction's caller class, name, and method type.
 * If the {@code invokedynamic} instruction specifies one or more static arguments,
 * those values will be passed as additional arguments to the method handle.
 * (Note that because there is a limit of 255 arguments to any method,
 * at most 251 extra arguments can be supplied, since the bootstrap method
 * handle itself and its first three arguments must also be stacked.)
 * The bootstrap method will be invoked as if by either {@code MethodHandle.invoke}
 * or {@code invokeWithArguments}.  (There is no way to tell the difference.)
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The normal argument conversion rules for {@code MethodHandle.invoke} apply to all stacked arguments.
 * For example, if a pushed value is a primitive type, it may be converted to a reference by boxing conversion.
 * If the bootstrap method is a variable arity method (its modifier bit {@code 0x0080} is set),
 * then some or all of the arguments specified here may be collected into a trailing array parameter.
 * (This is not a special rule, but rather a useful consequence of the interaction
 * between {@code CONSTANT_MethodHandle} constants, the modifier bit for variable arity methods,
 * and the {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle#asVarargsCollector asVarargsCollector} transformation.)
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given these rules, here are examples of legal bootstrap method declarations,
 * given various numbers {@code N} of extra arguments.
 * The first rows (marked {@code *}) will work for any number of extra arguments.
 * &lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary=&quot;Static argument types&quot;&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;N&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;sample bootstrap method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Lookup caller, String name, MethodType type, Object... args)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Object... args)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Object caller, Object... nameAndTypeWithArgs)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Lookup caller, String name, MethodType type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Lookup caller, Object... nameAndType)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Lookup caller, String name, MethodType type, Object arg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Lookup caller, String name, MethodType type, Object... args)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Lookup caller, String name, MethodType type, String... args)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallSite bootstrap(Lookup caller, String name, MethodType type, String x, int y)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 * The last example assumes that the extra arguments are of type
 * {@code CONSTANT_String} and {@code CONSTANT_Integer}, respectively.
 * The second-to-last example assumes that all extra arguments are of type
 * {@code CONSTANT_String}.
 * The other examples work with all types of extra arguments.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * As noted above, the actual method type of the bootstrap method can vary.
 * For example, the fourth argument could be {@code MethodHandle},
 * if that is the type of the corresponding constant in
 * the {@code CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic} entry.
 * In that case, the {@code MethodHandle.invoke} call will pass the extra method handle
 * constant as an {@code Object}, but the type matching machinery of {@code MethodHandle.invoke}
 * will cast the reference back to {@code MethodHandle} before invoking the bootstrap method.
 * (If a string constant were passed instead, by badly generated code, that cast would then fail,
 * resulting in a {@code BootstrapMethodError}.)
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that, as a consequence of the above rules, the bootstrap method may accept a primitive
 * argument, if it can be represented by a constant pool entry.
 * However, arguments of type {@code boolean}, {@code byte}, {@code short}, or {@code char}
 * cannot be created for bootstrap methods, since such constants cannot be directly
 * represented in the constant pool, and the invocation of the bootstrap method will
 * not perform the necessary narrowing primitive conversions.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Extra bootstrap method arguments are intended to allow language implementors
 * to safely and compactly encode metadata.
 * In principle, the name and extra arguments are redundant,
 * since each call site could be given its own unique bootstrap method.
 * Such a practice is likely to produce large class files and constant pools.
