/**
 * This interface imposes a total ordering on the objects of each class that
 * implements it.  This ordering is referred to as the class's &lt;i&gt;natural
 * ordering&lt;/i&gt;, and the class's &lt;tt&gt;compareTo&lt;/tt&gt; method is referred to as
 * its &lt;i&gt;natural comparison method&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * Lists (and arrays) of objects that implement this interface can be sorted
 * automatically by {@link Collections#sort(List) Collections.sort} (and
 * {@link Arrays#sort(Object[]) Arrays.sort}).  Objects that implement this
 * interface can be used as keys in a {@linkplain SortedMap sorted map} or as
 * elements in a {@linkplain SortedSet sorted set}, without the need to
 * specify a {@linkplain Comparator comparator}.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The natural ordering for a class &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt; is said to be &lt;i&gt;consistent
 * with equals&lt;/i&gt; if and only if &lt;tt&gt;e1.compareTo(e2) == 0&lt;/tt&gt; has
 * the same boolean value as &lt;tt&gt;e1.equals(e2)&lt;/tt&gt; for every
 * &lt;tt&gt;e1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;e2&lt;/tt&gt; of class &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt;.  Note that &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt;
 * is not an instance of any class, and &lt;tt&gt;e.compareTo(null)&lt;/tt&gt; should
 * throw a &lt;tt&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/tt&gt; even though &lt;tt&gt;e.equals(null)&lt;/tt&gt;
 * returns &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * It is strongly recommended (though not required) that natural orderings be
 * consistent with equals.  This is so because sorted sets (and sorted maps)
 * without explicit comparators behave &quot;strangely&quot; when they are used with
 * elements (or keys) whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals.  In
 * particular, such a sorted set (or sorted map) violates the general contract
 * for set (or map), which is defined in terms of the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt;
 * method.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * For example, if one adds two keys &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; such that
 * {@code (!a.equals(b) &amp;&amp; a.compareTo(b) == 0)} to a sorted
 * set that does not use an explicit comparator, the second &lt;tt&gt;add&lt;/tt&gt;
 * operation returns false (and the size of the sorted set does not increase)
 * because &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; are equivalent from the sorted set's
 * perspective.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * Virtually all Java core classes that implement &lt;tt&gt;Comparable&lt;/tt&gt; have natural
 * orderings that are consistent with equals.  One exception is
 * &lt;tt&gt;java.math.BigDecimal&lt;/tt&gt;, whose natural ordering equates
 * &lt;tt&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/tt&gt; objects with equal values and different precisions
 * (such as 4.0 and 4.00).&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * For the mathematically inclined, the &lt;i&gt;relation&lt;/i&gt; that defines
 * the natural ordering on a given class C is:&lt;pre&gt;
 *       {(x, y) such that x.compareTo(y) &amp;lt;= 0}.
 * &lt;/pre&gt; The &lt;i&gt;quotient&lt;/i&gt; for this total order is: &lt;pre&gt;
 *       {(x, y) such that x.compareTo(y) == 0}.
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * It follows immediately from the contract for &lt;tt&gt;compareTo&lt;/tt&gt; that the
 * quotient is an &lt;i&gt;equivalence relation&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt;, and that the
 * natural ordering is a &lt;i&gt;total order&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt;.  When we say that a
 * class's natural ordering is &lt;i&gt;consistent with equals&lt;/i&gt;, we mean that the
 * quotient for the natural ordering is the equivalence relation defined by
 * the class's {@link Object#equals(Object) equals(Object)} method:&lt;pre&gt;
 *     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * This interface is a member of the
 * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html&quot;&gt;
 * Java Collections Framework&lt;/a&gt;.

     * &lt;p&gt;The implementor must ensure &lt;tt&gt;sgn(x.compareTo(y)) ==

     * &lt;p&gt;The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
