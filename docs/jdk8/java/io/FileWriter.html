/**
 * Convenience class for writing character files.  The constructors of this
 * class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer
 * size are acceptable.  To specify these values yourself, construct an
 * OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the
 * underlying platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be
 * opened for writing by only one &lt;tt&gt;FileWriter&lt;/tt&gt; (or other file-writing
 * object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in this class
 * will fail if the file involved is already open.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt; is meant for writing streams of characters.
 * For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using a
 * &lt;code&gt;FileOutputStream&lt;/code&gt;.
