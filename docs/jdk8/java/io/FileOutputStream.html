/**
 * A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a
 * &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; or to a &lt;code&gt;FileDescriptor&lt;/code&gt;. Whether or not
 * a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying
 * platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened
 * for writing by only one &lt;tt&gt;FileOutputStream&lt;/tt&gt; (or other
 * file-writing object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in
 * this class will fail if the file involved is already open.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileOutputStream&lt;/code&gt; is meant for writing streams of raw bytes
 * such as image data. For writing streams of characters, consider using
 * &lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt;.
