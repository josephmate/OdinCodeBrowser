/**
 * An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent &lt;em&gt;pathname
 * strings&lt;/em&gt; to name files and directories.  This class presents an
 * abstract, system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames.  An
 * &lt;em&gt;abstract pathname&lt;/em&gt; has two components:
 *
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt; An optional system-dependent &lt;em&gt;prefix&lt;/em&gt; string,
 *      such as a disk-drive specifier, &lt;code&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the UNIX root
 *      directory, or &lt;code&gt;&quot;\\\\&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and
 * &lt;li&gt; A sequence of zero or more string &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt;.
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * The first name in an abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the
 * case of Microsoft Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname.  Each subsequent name
 * in an abstract pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote
 * either a directory or a file.  The &lt;em&gt;empty&lt;/em&gt; abstract pathname has no
 * prefix and an empty name sequence.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is
 * inherently system-dependent.  When an abstract pathname is converted into a
 * pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of
 * the default &lt;em&gt;separator character&lt;/em&gt;.  The default name-separator
 * character is defined by the system property &lt;code&gt;file.separator&lt;/code&gt;, and
 * is made available in the public static fields &lt;code&gt;{@link
 * #separator}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{@link #separatorChar}&lt;/code&gt; of this class.
 * When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names
 * within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any
 * other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either
 * &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt;.  An absolute pathname is complete in
 * that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it
 * denotes.  A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of
 * information taken from some other pathname.  By default the classes in the
 * &lt;code&gt;java.io&lt;/code&gt; package always resolve relative pathnames against the
 * current user directory.  This directory is named by the system property
 * &lt;code&gt;user.dir&lt;/code&gt;, and is typically the directory in which the Java
 * virtual machine was invoked.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The &lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt; of an abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking
 * the {@link #getParent} method of this class and consists of the pathname's
 * prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last.
 * Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of any &lt;tt&gt;File&lt;/tt&gt;
 * object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with the directory's
 * absolute pathname.  For example, the directory denoted by the abstract
 * pathname &lt;tt&gt;&quot;/usr&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is an ancestor of the directory denoted by the
 * pathname &lt;tt&gt;&quot;/usr/local/bin&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms,
 * and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms,
 * as follows:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt; For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always
 * &lt;code&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  Relative pathnames have no prefix.  The abstract pathname
 * denoting the root directory has the prefix &lt;code&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and an empty
 * name sequence.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt; For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive
 * specifier consists of the drive letter followed by &lt;code&gt;&quot;:&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and
 * possibly followed by &lt;code&gt;&quot;\\&quot;&lt;/code&gt; if the pathname is absolute.  The
 * prefix of a UNC pathname is &lt;code&gt;&quot;\\\\&quot;&lt;/code&gt;; the hostname and the share
 * name are the first two names in the name sequence.  A relative pathname that
 * does not specify a drive has no prefix.
 *
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Instances of this class may or may not denote an actual file-system
 * object such as a file or a directory.  If it does denote such an object
 * then that object resides in a &lt;i&gt;partition&lt;/i&gt;.  A partition is an
 * operating system-specific portion of storage for a file system.  A single
 * storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive, flash memory, CD-ROM) may
 * contain multiple partitions.  The object, if any, will reside on the
 * partition &lt;a name=&quot;partName&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; by some ancestor of the absolute
 * form of this pathname.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the
 * actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and executing.  These
 * restrictions are collectively known as &lt;i&gt;access permissions&lt;/i&gt;.  The file
 * system may have multiple sets of access permissions on a single object.
 * For example, one set may apply to the object's &lt;i&gt;owner&lt;/i&gt;, and another
 * may apply to all other users.  The access permissions on an object may
 * cause some methods in this class to fail.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Instances of the &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; class are immutable; that is, once
 * created, the abstract pathname represented by a &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; object
 * will never change.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Interoperability with {@code java.nio.file} package&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;../../java/nio/file/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;{@code java.nio.file}&lt;/a&gt;
 * package defines interfaces and classes for the Java virtual machine to access
 * files, file attributes, and file systems. This API may be used to overcome
 * many of the limitations of the {@code java.io.File} class.
 * The {@link #toPath toPath} method may be used to obtain a {@link
 * Path} that uses the abstract path represented by a {@code File} object to
 * locate a file. The resulting {@code Path} may be used with the {@link
 * java.nio.file.Files} class to provide more efficient and extensive access to
 * additional file operations, file attributes, and I/O exceptions to help
 * diagnose errors when an operation on a file fails.

     *      abstract pathname again in the current invocation of the virtual
     *      machine.
     * &lt;/ol&gt;
     *
     * This method provides only part of a temporary-file facility.  To arrange
     * for a file created by this method to be deleted automatically, use the
     * &lt;code&gt;{@link #deleteOnExit}&lt;/code&gt; method.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; The &lt;code&gt;prefix&lt;/code&gt; argument must be at least three characters
     * long.  It is recommended that the prefix be a short, meaningful string
     * such as &lt;code&gt;&quot;hjb&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&quot;mail&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  The
     * &lt;code&gt;suffix&lt;/code&gt; argument may be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the
     * suffix &lt;code&gt;&quot;.tmp&quot;&lt;/code&gt; will be used.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; To create the new file, the prefix and the suffix may first be
     * adjusted to fit the limitations of the underlying platform.  If the
     * prefix is too long then it will be truncated, but its first three
     * characters will always be preserved.  If the suffix is too long then it
     * too will be truncated, but if it begins with a period character
     * (&lt;code&gt;'.'&lt;/code&gt;) then the period and the first three characters
     * following it will always be preserved.  Once these adjustments have been
     * made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the
     * prefix, five or more internally-generated characters, and the suffix.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; If the &lt;code&gt;directory&lt;/code&gt; argument is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; then the
     * system-dependent default temporary-file directory will be used.  The
     * default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property
     * &lt;code&gt;java.io.tmpdir&lt;/code&gt;.  On UNIX systems the default value of this
     * property is typically &lt;code&gt;&quot;/tmp&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&quot;/var/tmp&quot;&lt;/code&gt;; on
     * Microsoft Windows systems it is typically &lt;code&gt;&quot;C:\\WINNT\\TEMP&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  A different
     * value may be given to this system property when the Java virtual machine
     * is invoked, but programmatic changes to this property are not guaranteed
     * to have any effect upon the temporary directory used by this method.
