/**
 * A piped output stream can be connected to a piped input stream
 * to create a communications pipe. The piped output stream is the
 * sending end of the pipe. Typically, data is written to a
 * &lt;code&gt;PipedOutputStream&lt;/code&gt; object by one thread and data is
 * read from the connected &lt;code&gt;PipedInputStream&lt;/code&gt; by some
 * other thread. Attempting to use both objects from a single thread
 * is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
 * The pipe is said to be &lt;a name=BROKEN&gt; &lt;i&gt;broken&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt; if a
 * thread that was reading data bytes from the connected piped input
 * stream is no longer alive.
