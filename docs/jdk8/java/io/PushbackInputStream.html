/**
 * A &lt;code&gt;PushbackInputStream&lt;/code&gt; adds
 * functionality to another input stream, namely
 * the  ability to &quot;push back&quot; or &quot;unread&quot;
 * one byte. This is useful in situations where
 * it is  convenient for a fragment of code
 * to read an indefinite number of data bytes
 * that  are delimited by a particular byte
 * value; after reading the terminating byte,
 * the  code fragment can &quot;unread&quot; it, so that
 * the next read operation on the input stream
 * will reread the byte that was pushed back.
 * For example, bytes representing the  characters
 * constituting an identifier might be terminated
 * by a byte representing an  operator character;
 * a method whose job is to read just an identifier
 * can read until it  sees the operator and
 * then push the operator back to be re-read.
