/**
 * An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; An asynchronous server-socket channel is created by invoking the
 * {@link #open open} method of this class.
 * A newly-created asynchronous server-socket channel is open but not yet bound.
 * It can be bound to a local address and configured to listen for connections
 * by invoking the {@link #bind(SocketAddress,int) bind} method. Once bound,
 * the {@link #accept(Object,CompletionHandler) accept} method
 * is used to initiate the accepting of connections to the channel's socket.
 * An attempt to invoke the &lt;tt&gt;accept&lt;/tt&gt; method on an unbound channel will
 * cause a {@link NotYetBoundException} to be thrown.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads
 * though at most one accept operation can be outstanding at any time.
 * If a thread initiates an accept operation before a previous accept operation
 * has completed then an {@link AcceptPendingException} will be thrown.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 * setOption} method. Channels of this type support the following options:
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;table border summary=&quot;Socket options&quot;&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;th&gt;Option Name&lt;/th&gt;
 *     &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket receive buffer &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; Re-use address &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 * Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *  final AsynchronousServerSocketChannel listener =
 *      AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.open().bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000));
 *
 *  listener.accept(null, new CompletionHandler&amp;lt;AsynchronousSocketChannel,Void&amp;gt;() {
 *      public void completed(AsynchronousSocketChannel ch, Void att) {
 *          // accept the next connection
 *          listener.accept(null, this);
 *
 *          // handle this connection
 *          handle(ch);
 *      }
 *      public void failed(Throwable exc, Void att) {
 *          ...
 *      }
 *  });
