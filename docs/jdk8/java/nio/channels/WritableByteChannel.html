     * &lt;p&gt; An attempt is made to write up to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; bytes to the channel,
     * where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,
     * &lt;tt&gt;src.remaining()&lt;/tt&gt;, at the moment this method is invoked.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; Suppose that a byte sequence of length &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is written, where
     * &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;.
     * This byte sequence will be transferred from the buffer starting at index
     * &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is the buffer's position at the moment this
     * method is invoked; the index of the last byte written will be

     * none at all.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot
     * write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
     * already initiated a write operation upon this channel, however, then an
