/**
 * A network channel that supports Internet Protocol (IP) multicasting.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; IP multicasting is the transmission of IP datagrams to members of
 * a &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; that is zero or more hosts identified by a single destination
 * address.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; In the case of a channel to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET IPv4} socket,
 * the underlying operating system supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2236.txt&quot;&gt;
 * &lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;2236: Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2 (IGMPv2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 * It may optionally support source filtering as specified by &lt;a
 * href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3376.txt&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;3376: Internet Group
 * Management Protocol, Version 3 (IGMPv3)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 * For channels to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET6 IPv6} socket, the equivalent
 * standards are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2710.txt&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;2710:
 * Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
 * href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3810.txt&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;3810: Multicast Listener
 * Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link #join(InetAddress,NetworkInterface)} method is used to
 * join a group and receive all multicast datagrams sent to the group. A channel
 * may join several multicast groups and may join the same group on several
 * {@link NetworkInterface interfaces}. Membership is dropped by invoking the {@link
 * MembershipKey#drop drop} method on the returned {@link MembershipKey}. If the
 * underlying platform supports source filtering then the {@link MembershipKey#block
 * block} and {@link MembershipKey#unblock unblock} methods can be used to block or
 * unblock multicast datagrams from particular source addresses.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link #join(InetAddress,NetworkInterface,InetAddress)} method
 * is used to begin receiving datagrams sent to a group whose source address matches
 * a given source address. This method throws {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
 * if the underlying platform does not support source filtering.  Membership is
 * &lt;em&gt;cumulative&lt;/em&gt; and this method may be invoked again with the same group
 * and interface to allow receiving datagrams from other source addresses. The
 * method returns a {@link MembershipKey} that represents membership to receive
 * datagrams from the given source address. Invoking the key's {@link
 * MembershipKey#drop drop} method drops membership so that datagrams from the
 * source address can no longer be received.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;Platform dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;
 *
 * The multicast implementation is intended to map directly to the native
 * multicasting facility. Consequently, the following items should be considered
 * when developing an application that receives IP multicast datagrams:
 *
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The creation of the channel should specify the {@link ProtocolFamily}
 * that corresponds to the address type of the multicast groups that the channel
 * will join. There is no guarantee that a channel to a socket in one protocol
 * family can join and receive multicast datagrams when the address of the
 * multicast group corresponds to another protocol family. For example, it is
 * implementation specific if a channel to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET6 IPv6}
 * socket can join an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET IPv4} multicast group and receive
 * multicast datagrams sent to the group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The channel's socket should be bound to the {@link
 * InetAddress#isAnyLocalAddress wildcard} address. If the socket is bound to
 * a specific address, rather than the wildcard address then it is implementation
 * specific if multicast datagrams are received by the socket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} option should be
 * enabled prior to {@link NetworkChannel#bind binding} the socket. This is
 * required to allow multiple members of the group to bind to the same
 * address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     // join multicast group on this interface, and also use this
 *     // interface for outgoing multicast datagrams
 *     NetworkInterface ni = NetworkInterface.getByName(&quot;hme0&quot;);
 *
 *     DatagramChannel dc = DatagramChannel.open(StandardProtocolFamily.INET)
 *         .setOption(StandardSocketOptions.SO_REUSEADDR, true)
 *         .bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000))
 *         .setOption(StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_IF, ni);
 *
 *     InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(&quot;225.4.5.6&quot;);
 *
 *     MembershipKey key = dc.join(group, ni);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * @since 1.7
