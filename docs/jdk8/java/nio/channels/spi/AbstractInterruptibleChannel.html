/**
 * Base implementation class for interruptible channels.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; This class encapsulates the low-level machinery required to implement
 * the asynchronous closing and interruption of channels.  A concrete channel
 * class must invoke the {@link #begin begin} and {@link #end end} methods
 * before and after, respectively, invoking an I/O operation that might block
 * indefinitely.  In order to ensure that the {@link #end end} method is always
 * invoked, these methods should be used within a
 * &lt;tt&gt;try&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;finally&lt;/tt&gt; block:
 *
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 * boolean completed = false;
 * try {
 *     begin();
 *     completed = ...;    // Perform blocking I/O operation
 *     return ...;         // Return result
 * } finally {
 *     end(completed);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The &lt;tt&gt;completed&lt;/tt&gt; argument to the {@link #end end} method tells
 * whether or not the I/O operation actually completed, that is, whether it had
 * any effect that would be visible to the invoker.  In the case of an
 * operation that reads bytes, for example, this argument should be
 * &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; if, and only if, some bytes were actually transferred into the
 * invoker's target buffer.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A concrete channel class must also implement the {@link
 * #implCloseChannel implCloseChannel} method in such a way that if it is
 * invoked while another thread is blocked in a native I/O operation upon the
 * channel then that operation will immediately return, either by throwing an
 * exception or by returning normally.  If a thread is interrupted or the
 * channel upon which it is blocked is asynchronously closed then the channel's
 * {@link #end end} method will throw the appropriate exception.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; This class performs the synchronization required to implement the {@link
 * java.nio.channels.Channel} specification.  Implementations of the {@link
 * #implCloseChannel implCloseChannel} method need not synchronize against
 * other threads that might be attempting to close the channel.  &lt;/p&gt;
