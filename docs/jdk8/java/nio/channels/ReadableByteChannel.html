     * Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

     * &lt;p&gt; An attempt is made to read up to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; bytes from the channel,
     * where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,
     * &lt;tt&gt;dst.remaining()&lt;/tt&gt;, at the moment this method is invoked.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; Suppose that a byte sequence of length &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is read, where
     * &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;.
     * This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first
     * byte in the sequence is at index &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and the last byte is at index
     * &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;,

     * invoked.  Upon return the buffer's position will be equal to
     * &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;; its limit will not have changed.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; A read operation might not fill the buffer, and in fact it might not
     * read any bytes at all.  Whether or not it does so depends upon the
     * nature and state of the channel.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode,
     * for example, cannot read any more bytes than are immediately available
     * from the socket's input buffer; similarly, a file channel cannot read
     * any more bytes than remain in the file.  It is guaranteed, however, that
     * if a channel is in blocking mode and there is at least one byte
     * remaining in the buffer then this method will block until at least one
     * byte is read.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
     * already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an
     * invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
     * complete. &lt;/p&gt;
