/**
 * A channel that supports asynchronous I/O operations. Asynchronous I/O
 * operations will usually take one of two forms:
 *
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@link Future}&amp;lt;V&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;operation&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;pre&gt;void &lt;em&gt;operation&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt; A attachment, {@link
 *   CompletionHandler}&amp;lt;V,? super A&amp;gt; handler)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * where &lt;i&gt;operation&lt;/i&gt; is the name of the I/O operation (read or write for
 * example), &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; is the result type of the I/O operation, and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; is
 * the type of an object attached to the I/O operation to provide context when
 * consuming the result. The attachment is important for cases where a
 * &lt;em&gt;state-less&lt;/em&gt; {@code CompletionHandler} is used to consume the result
 * of many I/O operations.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; In the first form, the methods defined by the {@link Future Future}
 * interface may be used to check if the operation has completed, wait for its
 * completion, and to retrieve the result. In the second form, a {@link
 * CompletionHandler} is invoked to consume the result of the I/O operation when
 * it completes or fails.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A channel that implements this interface is &lt;em&gt;asynchronously
 * closeable&lt;/em&gt;: If an I/O operation is outstanding on the channel and the
 * channel's {@link #close close} method is invoked, then the I/O operation
 * fails with the exception {@link AsynchronousCloseException}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Asynchronous channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 * Some channel implementations may support concurrent reading and writing, but
 * may not allow more than one read and one write operation to be outstanding at
 * any given time.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;Cancellation&lt;/h2&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@code Future} interface defines the {@link Future#cancel cancel}
 * method to cancel execution. This causes all threads waiting on the result of
 * the I/O operation to throw {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}.
 * Whether the underlying I/O operation can be cancelled is highly implementation
 * specific and therefore not specified. Where cancellation leaves the channel,
 * or the entity to which it is connected, in an inconsistent state, then the
 * channel is put into an implementation specific &lt;em&gt;error state&lt;/em&gt; that
 * prevents further attempts to initiate I/O operations that are &lt;i&gt;similar&lt;/i&gt;
 * to the operation that was cancelled. For example, if a read operation is
 * cancelled but the implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been
 * read from the channel then it puts the channel into an error state; further
 * attempts to initiate a {@code read} operation cause an unspecified runtime
 * exception to be thrown. Similarly, if a write operation is cancelled but the
 * implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written to the
 * channel then subsequent attempts to initiate a {@code write} will fail with
 * an unspecified runtime exception.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Where the {@link Future#cancel cancel} method is invoked with the {@code
 * mayInterruptIfRunning} parameter set to {@code true} then the I/O operation
 * may be interrupted by closing the channel. In that case all threads waiting
 * on the result of the I/O operation throw {@code CancellationException} and
 * any other I/O operations outstanding on the channel complete with the
 * exception {@link AsynchronousCloseException}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Where the {@code cancel} method is invoked to cancel read or write
 * operations then it is recommended that all buffers used in the I/O operations
 * be discarded or care taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while
 * the channel remains open.
