/**
 * A token representing the registration of a {@link SelectableChannel} with a
 * {@link Selector}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A selection key is created each time a channel is registered with a
 * selector.  A key remains valid until it is &lt;i&gt;cancelled&lt;/i&gt; by invoking its
 * {@link #cancel cancel} method, by closing its channel, or by closing its
 * selector.  Cancelling a key does not immediately remove it from its
 * selector; it is instead added to the selector's &lt;a
 * href=&quot;Selector.html#ks&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;cancelled-key set&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for removal during the
 * next selection operation.  The validity of a key may be tested by invoking
 * its {@link #isValid isValid} method.
 *
 * &lt;a name=&quot;opsets&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A selection key contains two &lt;i&gt;operation sets&lt;/i&gt; represented as
 * integer values.  Each bit of an operation set denotes a category of
 * selectable operations that are supported by the key's channel.
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;interest set&lt;/i&gt; determines which operation categories will
 *   be tested for readiness the next time one of the selector's selection
 *   methods is invoked.  The interest set is initialized with the value given
 *   when the key is created; it may later be changed via the {@link
 *   #interestOps(int)} method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;ready set&lt;/i&gt; identifies the operation categories for which
 *   the key's channel has been detected to be ready by the key's selector.
 *   The ready set is initialized to zero when the key is created; it may later
 *   be updated by the selector during a selection operation, but it cannot be
 *   updated directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; That a selection key's ready set indicates that its channel is ready for
 * some operation category is a hint, but not a guarantee, that an operation in
 * such a category may be performed by a thread without causing the thread to
 * block.  A ready set is most likely to be accurate immediately after the
 * completion of a selection operation.  It is likely to be made inaccurate by
 * external events and by I/O operations that are invoked upon the
 * corresponding channel.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; This class defines all known operation-set bits, but precisely which
 * bits are supported by a given channel depends upon the type of the channel.
 * Each subclass of {@link SelectableChannel} defines an {@link
 * SelectableChannel#validOps() validOps()} method which returns a set
 * identifying just those operations that are supported by the channel.  An
 * attempt to set or test an operation-set bit that is not supported by a key's
 * channel will result in an appropriate run-time exception.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; It is often necessary to associate some application-specific data with a
 * selection key, for example an object that represents the state of a
 * higher-level protocol and handles readiness notifications in order to
 * implement that protocol.  Selection keys therefore support the
 * &lt;i&gt;attachment&lt;/i&gt; of a single arbitrary object to a key.  An object can be
 * attached via the {@link #attach attach} method and then later retrieved via
 * the {@link #attachment() attachment} method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Selection keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  The
 * operations of reading and writing the interest set will, in general, be
 * synchronized with certain operations of the selector.  Exactly how this
 * synchronization is performed is implementation-dependent: In a naive
 * implementation, reading or writing the interest set may block indefinitely
 * if a selection operation is already in progress; in a high-performance
 * implementation, reading or writing the interest set may block briefly, if at
 * all.  In any case, a selection operation will always use the interest-set
 * value that was current at the moment that the operation began.  &lt;/p&gt;
