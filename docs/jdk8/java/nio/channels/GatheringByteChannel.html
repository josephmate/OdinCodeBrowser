/**
 * A channel that can write bytes from a sequence of buffers.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A &lt;i&gt;gathering&lt;/i&gt; write operation writes, in a single invocation, a
 * sequence of bytes from one or more of a given sequence of buffers.
 * Gathering writes are often useful when implementing network protocols or
 * file formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one
 * or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar
 * &lt;i&gt;scattering&lt;/i&gt; read operations are defined in the {@link
 * ScatteringByteChannel} interface.  &lt;/p&gt;

     * Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the
     * given buffers.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; An attempt is made to write up to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; bytes to this channel,
     * where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
     * subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,
     *
     * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     * srcs[offset].remaining()
     *     + srcs[offset+1].remaining()
     *     + ... + srcs[offset+length-1].remaining()&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
     *
     * at the moment that this method is invoked.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; Suppose that a byte sequence of length &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is written, where
     * &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;.
     * Up to the first &lt;tt&gt;srcs[offset].remaining()&lt;/tt&gt; bytes of this sequence
     * are written from buffer &lt;tt&gt;srcs[offset]&lt;/tt&gt;, up to the next
     * &lt;tt&gt;srcs[offset+1].remaining()&lt;/tt&gt; bytes are written from buffer
     * &lt;tt&gt;srcs[offset+1]&lt;/tt&gt;, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is
     * written.  As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer, hence
     * the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated
     * buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise specified, a write operation will return only after
     * writing all of the &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; requested bytes.  Some types of channels,
     * depending upon their state, may write only some of the bytes or possibly
     * none at all.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot
     * write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
     * already initiated a write operation upon this channel, however, then an
     * invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
     * complete. &lt;/p&gt;
