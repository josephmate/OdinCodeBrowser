/**
 * An asynchronous channel for reading, writing, and manipulating a file.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; An asynchronous file channel is created when a file is opened by invoking
 * one of the {@link #open open} methods defined by this class. The file contains
 * a variable-length sequence of bytes that can be read and written and whose
 * current size can be {@link #size() queried}. The size of the file increases
 * when bytes are written beyond its  current size; the size of the file decreases
 * when it is {@link #truncate truncated}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; An asynchronous file channel does not have a &lt;i&gt;current position&lt;/i&gt;
 * within the file. Instead, the file position is specified to each read and
 * write method that initiates asynchronous operations. A {@link CompletionHandler}
 * is specified as a parameter and is invoked to consume the result of the I/O
 * operation. This class also defines read and write methods that initiate
 * asynchronous operations, returning a {@link Future} to represent the pending
 * result of the operation. The {@code Future} may be used to check if the
 * operation has completed, wait for its completion, and retrieve the result.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; In addition to read and write operations, this class defines the
 * following operations: &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Updates made to a file may be {@link #force &lt;i&gt;forced
 *   out&lt;/i&gt;} to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
 *   lost in the event of a system crash.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; A region of a file may be {@link #lock &lt;i&gt;locked&lt;/i&gt;} against
 *   access by other programs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; An {@code AsynchronousFileChannel} is associated with a thread pool to
 * which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to completion
 * handlers that consume the results of I/O operations on the channel. The
 * completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a channel is guaranteed
 * to be invoked by one of the threads in the thread pool (This ensures that the
 * completion handler is run by a thread with the expected &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;).
 * Where an I/O operation completes immediately, and the initiating thread is
 * itself a thread in the thread pool, then the completion handler may be invoked
 * directly by the initiating thread. When an {@code AsynchronousFileChannel} is
 * created without specifying a thread pool then the channel is associated with
 * a system-dependent default thread pool that may be shared with other
 * channels. The default thread pool is configured by the system properties
 * defined by the {@link AsynchronousChannelGroup} class.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The
 * {@link Channel#close close} method may be invoked at any time, as specified
 * by the {@link Channel} interface. This causes all outstanding asynchronous
 * operations on the channel to complete with the exception {@link
 * AsynchronousCloseException}. Multiple read and write operations may be
 * outstanding at the same time. When multiple read and write operations are
 * outstanding then the ordering of the I/O operations, and the order that the
 * completion handlers are invoked, is not specified; they are not, in particular,
 * guaranteed to execute in the order that the operations were initiated. The
 * {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer ByteBuffers} used when reading or writing are not
 * safe for use by multiple concurrent I/O operations. Furthermore, after an I/O
 * operation is initiated then care should be taken to ensure that the buffer is
 * not accessed until after the operation has completed.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; As with {@link FileChannel}, the view of a file provided by an instance of
 * this class is guaranteed to be consistent with other views of the same file
 * provided by other instances in the same program.  The view provided by an
 * instance of this class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views
 * seen by other concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the
 * underlying operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols.
 * This is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
 * written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
 * machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
 * and are therefore unspecified.

     * &lt;p&gt; The {@code options} parameter determines how the file is opened.
     * The {@link StandardOpenOption#READ READ} and {@link StandardOpenOption#WRITE
     * WRITE} options determines if the file should be opened for reading and/or
     * writing. If neither option is contained in the array then an existing file
     * is opened for  reading.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; In addition to {@code READ} and {@code WRITE}, the following options
     * may be present:
     *
     * &lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary=&quot;&quot;&gt;
     * &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Option&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

     *   &lt;td&gt; {@link StandardOpenOption#TRUNCATE_EXISTING TRUNCATE_EXISTING} &lt;/td&gt;
     *   &lt;td&gt; When opening an existing file, the file is first truncated to a

     *   the file already exists. When creating a file the check for the
     *   existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
     *   is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is
     *   ignored when the file is opened only for reading. &lt;/td&gt;

     *   exists, otherwise a new file is created. When creating a file the check
     *   for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does
     *   not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This
     *   option is ignored if the {@code CREATE_NEW} option is also present or
     *   the file is opened only for reading. &lt;/td&gt;
     * &lt;/tr&gt;

     *   &lt;td &gt; {@link StandardOpenOption#DELETE_ON_CLOSE DELETE_ON_CLOSE} &lt;/td&gt;
     *   &lt;td&gt; When this option is present then the implementation makes a
     *   &lt;em&gt;best effort&lt;/em&gt; attempt to delete the file when closed by the
     *   the {@link #close close} method. If the {@code close} method is not
     *   invoked then a &lt;em&gt;best effort&lt;/em&gt; attempt is made to delete the file
     *   when the Java virtual machine terminates. &lt;/td&gt;
     * &lt;/tr&gt;
     * &lt;tr&gt;
     *   &lt;td&gt;{@link StandardOpenOption#SPARSE SPARSE} &lt;/td&gt;
     *   &lt;td&gt; When creating a new file this option is a &lt;em&gt;hint&lt;/em&gt; that the
     *   new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating

     * &lt;tr&gt;
     *   &lt;td&gt; {@link StandardOpenOption#SYNC SYNC} &lt;/td&gt;
     *   &lt;td&gt; Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
     *   written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see &lt;a
     *   href=&quot;../file/package-summary.html#integrity&quot;&gt; Synchronized I/O file

     * &lt;p&gt; An implementation may also support additional options.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; The {@code executor} parameter is the {@link ExecutorService} to
     * which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch completion
     * results for operations initiated on resulting channel.
     * The nature of these tasks is highly implementation specific and so care
