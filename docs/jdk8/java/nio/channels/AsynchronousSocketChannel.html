/**
 * An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A newly-created
 * {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} is created by invoking one of the {@link
 * #open open} methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is open but
 * not yet connected. A connected {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} is created
 * when a connection is made to the socket of an {@link AsynchronousServerSocketChannel}.
 * It is not possible to create an asynchronous socket channel for an arbitrary,
 * pre-existing {@link java.net.Socket socket}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A newly-created channel is connected by invoking its {@link #connect connect}
 * method; once connected, a channel remains connected until it is closed.  Whether
 * or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking its {@link
 * #getRemoteAddress getRemoteAddress} method. An attempt to invoke an I/O
 * operation upon an unconnected channel will cause a {@link NotYetConnectedException}
 * to be thrown.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 * They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read operation
 * and one write operation can be outstanding at any time.
 * If a thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
 * completed then a {@link ReadPendingException} will be thrown. Similarly, an
 * attempt to initiate a write operation before a previous write has completed
 * will throw a {@link WritePendingException}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 * setOption} method. Asynchronous socket channels support the following options:
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;table border summary=&quot;Socket options&quot;&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;th&gt;Option Name&lt;/th&gt;
 *     &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket send buffer &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket receive buffer &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_KEEPALIVE SO_KEEPALIVE} &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; Keep connection alive &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; Re-use address &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#TCP_NODELAY TCP_NODELAY} &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; Disable the Nagle algorithm &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 * Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;Timeouts&lt;/h2&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link #read(ByteBuffer,long,TimeUnit,Object,CompletionHandler) read}
 * and {@link #write(ByteBuffer,long,TimeUnit,Object,CompletionHandler) write}
 * methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be specified when initiating
 * a read or write operation. If the timeout elapses before an operation completes
 * then the operation completes with the exception {@link
 * InterruptedByTimeoutException}. A timeout may leave the channel, or the
 * underlying connection, in an inconsistent state. Where the implementation
 * cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read from the channel then it puts
 * the channel into an implementation specific &lt;em&gt;error state&lt;/em&gt;. A subsequent
 * attempt to initiate a {@code read} operation causes an unspecified runtime
 * exception to be thrown. Similarly if a {@code write} operation times out and
 * the implementation cannot guarantee bytes have not been written to the
 * channel then further attempts to {@code write} to the channel cause an
 * unspecified runtime exception to be thrown. When a timeout elapses then the
 * state of the {@link ByteBuffer}, or the sequence of buffers, for the I/O
 * operation is not defined. Buffers should be discarded or at least care must
 * be taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while the channel remains
 * open. All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less than or
 * equal to zero to mean that the I/O operation does not timeout.
 *
