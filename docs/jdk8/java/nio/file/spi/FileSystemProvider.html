/**
 * Service-provider class for file systems. The methods defined by the {@link
 * java.nio.file.Files} class will typically delegate to an instance of this
 * class.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A file system provider is a concrete implementation of this class that
 * implements the abstract methods defined by this class. A provider is
 * identified by a {@code URI} {@link #getScheme() scheme}. The default provider
 * is identified by the URI scheme &quot;file&quot;. It creates the {@link FileSystem} that
 * provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual machine.
 * The {@link FileSystems} class defines how file system providers are located
 * and loaded. The default provider is typically a system-default provider but
 * may be overridden if the system property {@code
 * java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider} is set. In that case, the
 * provider has a one argument constructor whose formal parameter type is {@code
 * FileSystemProvider}. All other providers have a zero argument constructor
 * that initializes the provider.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A provider is a factory for one or more {@link FileSystem} instances. Each
 * file system is identified by a {@code URI} where the URI's scheme matches
 * the provider's {@link #getScheme scheme}. The default file system, for example,
 * is identified by the URI {@code &quot;file:///&quot;}. A memory-based file system,
 * for example, may be identified by a URI such as {@code &quot;memory:///?name=logfs&quot;}.
 * The {@link #newFileSystem newFileSystem} method may be used to create a file
 * system, and the {@link #getFileSystem getFileSystem} method may be used to
 * obtain a reference to an existing file system created by the provider. Where
 * a provider is the factory for a single file system then it is provider dependent
 * if the file system is created when the provider is initialized, or later when
 * the {@code newFileSystem} method is invoked. In the case of the default
 * provider, the {@code FileSystem} is created when the provider is initialized.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 * threads.
 *
 * @since 1.7

     *   &lt;td&gt; {@link AccessMode#EXECUTE EXECUTE} &lt;/td&gt;
     *   &lt;td&gt; Checks that the file exists and that the Java virtual machine has
     *     permission to {@link Runtime#exec execute} the file. The semantics
     *     may differ when checking access to a directory. For example, on UNIX
     *     systems, checking for {@code EXECUTE} access checks that the Java
     *     virtual machine has permission to search the directory in order to
     *     access file or subdirectories. &lt;/td&gt;

     * &lt;p&gt; This method follows symbolic links if the file referenced by this
     * object is a symbolic link. Depending on the implementation, this method
     * may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or other
     * file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file. To
     * determine the effective access to a file may require access to several
     * attributes and so in some implementations this method may not be atomic
     * with respect to other file system operations.
