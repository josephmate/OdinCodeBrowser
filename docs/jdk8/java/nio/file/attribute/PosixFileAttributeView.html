/**
 * A file attribute view that provides a view of the file attributes commonly
 * associated with files on file systems used by operating systems that implement
 * the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) family of standards.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Operating systems that implement the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opengroup.org&quot;&gt;
 * POSIX&lt;/a&gt; family of standards commonly use file systems that have a
 * file &lt;em&gt;owner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;group-owner&lt;/em&gt;, and related &lt;em&gt;access
 * permissions&lt;/em&gt;. This file attribute view provides read and write access
 * to these attributes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link #readAttributes() readAttributes} method is used to read the
 * file's attributes. The file {@link PosixFileAttributes#owner() owner} is
 * represented by a {@link UserPrincipal} that is the identity of the file owner
 * for the purposes of access control. The {@link PosixFileAttributes#group()
 * group-owner}, represented by a {@link GroupPrincipal}, is the identity of the
 * group owner, where a group is an identity created for administrative purposes
 * so as to determine the access rights for the members of the group.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link PosixFileAttributes#permissions() permissions} attribute is a
 * set of access permissions. This file attribute view provides access to the nine
 * permission defined by the {@link PosixFilePermission} class.
 * These nine permission bits determine the &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt;, and
 * &lt;em&gt;execute&lt;/em&gt; access for the file owner, group, and others (others
 * meaning identities other than the owner and members of the group). Some
 * operating systems and file systems may provide additional permission bits
 * but access to these other bits is not defined by this class in this release.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 * Suppose we need to print out the owner and access permissions of a file:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     Path file = ...
 *     PosixFileAttributes attrs = Files.getFileAttributeView(file, PosixFileAttributeView.class)
 *         .readAttributes();
 *     System.out.format(&quot;%s %s%n&quot;,
 *         attrs.owner().getName(),
 *         PosixFilePermissions.toString(attrs.permissions()));
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt; Dynamic Access &lt;/h2&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt; Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes
 * supported by this attribute view are as defined by {@link
 * BasicFileAttributeView} and {@link FileOwnerAttributeView}, and in addition,
 * the following attributes are supported:
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; summary=&quot;Supported attributes&quot;&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;th&gt; Name &lt;/th&gt;
 *     &lt;th&gt; Type &lt;/th&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *  &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; &quot;permissions&quot; &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link Set}&amp;lt;{@link PosixFilePermission}&amp;gt; &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; &quot;group&quot; &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link GroupPrincipal} &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link Files#getAttribute getAttribute} method may be used to read
 * any of these attributes, or any of the attributes defined by {@link
 * BasicFileAttributeView} as if by invoking the {@link #readAttributes
 * readAttributes()} method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link Files#setAttribute setAttribute} method may be used to update
 * the file's last modified time, last access time or create time attributes as
 * defined by {@link BasicFileAttributeView}. It may also be used to update
 * the permissions, owner, or group-owner as if by invoking the {@link
 * #setPermissions setPermissions}, {@link #setOwner setOwner}, and {@link
 * #setGroup setGroup} methods respectively.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt; Setting Initial Permissions &lt;/h2&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt; Implementations supporting this attribute view may also support setting
 * the initial permissions when creating a file or directory. The
 * initial permissions are provided to the {@link Files#createFile createFile}
 * or {@link Files#createDirectory createDirectory} methods as a {@link
 * FileAttribute} with {@link FileAttribute#name name} {@code &quot;posix:permissions&quot;}
 * and a {@link FileAttribute#value value} that is the set of permissions. The
 * following example uses the {@link PosixFilePermissions#asFileAttribute
 * asFileAttribute} method to construct a {@code FileAttribute} when creating a
 * file:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     Path path = ...
 *     Set&amp;lt;PosixFilePermission&amp;gt; perms =
 *         EnumSet.of(OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ);
 *     Files.createFile(path, PosixFilePermissions.asFileAttribute(perms));
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; When the access permissions are set at file creation time then the actual
 * value of the permissions may differ that the value of the attribute object.
 * The reasons for this are implementation specific. On UNIX systems, for
 * example, a process has a &lt;em&gt;umask&lt;/em&gt; that impacts the permission bits
 * of newly created files. Where an implementation supports the setting of
 * the access permissions, and the underlying file system supports access
 * permissions, then it is required that the value of the actual access
 * permissions will be equal or less than the value of the attribute
 * provided to the {@link Files#createFile createFile} or {@link
 * Files#createDirectory createDirectory} methods. In other words, the file may
 * be more secure than requested.
 *
