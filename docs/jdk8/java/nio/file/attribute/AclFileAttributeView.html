/**
 * A file attribute view that supports reading or updating a file's Access
 * Control Lists (ACL) or file owner attributes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; ACLs are used to specify access rights to file system objects. An ACL is
 * an ordered list of {@link AclEntry access-control-entries}, each specifying a
 * {@link UserPrincipal} and the level of access for that user principal. This
 * file attribute view defines the {@link #getAcl() getAcl}, and {@link
 * #setAcl(List) setAcl} methods to read and write ACLs based on the ACL
 * model specified in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3530.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;3530:
 * Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This file attribute view
 * is intended for file system implementations that support the NFSv4 ACL model
 * or have a &lt;em&gt;well-defined&lt;/em&gt; mapping between the NFSv4 ACL model and the ACL
 * model used by the file system. The details of such mapping are implementation
 * dependent and are therefore unspecified.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; This class also extends {@code FileOwnerAttributeView} so as to define
 * methods to get and set the file owner.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; When a file system provides access to a set of {@link FileStore
 * file-systems} that are not homogeneous then only some of the file systems may
 * support ACLs. The {@link FileStore#supportsFileAttributeView
 * supportsFileAttributeView} method can be used to test if a file system
 * supports ACLs.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h2&gt;
 *
 * RFC&amp;nbsp;3530 allows for special user identities to be used on platforms that
 * support the POSIX defined access permissions. The special user identities
 * are &quot;{@code OWNER@}&quot;, &quot;{@code GROUP@}&quot;, and &quot;{@code EVERYONE@}&quot;. When both
 * the {@code AclFileAttributeView} and the {@link PosixFileAttributeView}
 * are supported then these special user identities may be included in ACL {@link
 * AclEntry entries} that are read or written. The file system's {@link
 * UserPrincipalLookupService} may be used to obtain a {@link UserPrincipal}
 * to represent these special identities by invoking the {@link
 * UserPrincipalLookupService#lookupPrincipalByName lookupPrincipalByName}
 * method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 * Suppose we wish to add an entry to an existing ACL to grant &quot;joe&quot; access:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     // lookup &quot;joe&quot;
 *     UserPrincipal joe = file.getFileSystem().getUserPrincipalLookupService()
 *         .lookupPrincipalByName(&quot;joe&quot;);
 *
 *     // get view
 *     AclFileAttributeView view = Files.getFileAttributeView(file, AclFileAttributeView.class);
 *
 *     // create ACE to give &quot;joe&quot; read access
 *     AclEntry entry = AclEntry.newBuilder()
 *         .setType(AclEntryType.ALLOW)
 *         .setPrincipal(joe)
 *         .setPermissions(AclEntryPermission.READ_DATA, AclEntryPermission.READ_ATTRIBUTES)
 *         .build();
 *
 *     // read ACL, insert ACE, re-write ACL
 *     List&amp;lt;AclEntry&amp;gt; acl = view.getAcl();
 *     acl.add(0, entry);   // insert before any DENY entries
 *     view.setAcl(acl);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt; Dynamic Access &lt;/h2&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt; Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes
 * supported by this attribute view are as follows:
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 * &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; summary=&quot;Supported attributes&quot;&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;th&gt; Name &lt;/th&gt;
 *     &lt;th&gt; Type &lt;/th&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; &quot;acl&quot; &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link List}&amp;lt;{@link AclEntry}&amp;gt; &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 *   &lt;tr&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; &quot;owner&quot; &lt;/td&gt;
 *     &lt;td&gt; {@link UserPrincipal} &lt;/td&gt;
 *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 * &lt;/table&gt;
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link Files#getAttribute getAttribute} method may be used to read
 * the ACL or owner attributes as if by invoking the {@link #getAcl getAcl} or
 * {@link #getOwner getOwner} methods.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The {@link Files#setAttribute setAttribute} method may be used to
 * update the ACL or owner attributes as if by invoking the {@link #setAcl setAcl}
 * or {@link #setOwner setOwner} methods.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt; Setting the ACL when creating a file &lt;/h2&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Implementations supporting this attribute view may also support setting
 * the initial ACL when creating a file or directory. The initial ACL
 * may be provided to methods such as {@link Files#createFile createFile} or {@link
 * Files#createDirectory createDirectory} as an {@link FileAttribute} with {@link
 * FileAttribute#name name} {@code &quot;acl:acl&quot;} and a {@link FileAttribute#value
 * value} that is the list of {@code AclEntry} objects.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Where an implementation supports an ACL model that differs from the NFSv4
 * defined ACL model then setting the initial ACL when creating the file must
 * translate the ACL to the model supported by the file system. Methods that
 * create a file should reject (by throwing {@link IOException IOException})
 * any attempt to create a file that would be less secure as a result of the
 * translation.
