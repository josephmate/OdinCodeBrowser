     * &lt;p&gt; The {@code options} parameter determines how the file is opened.
     * The {@link StandardOpenOption#READ READ} and {@link

     * opened for reading and/or writing. If neither option (or the {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#APPEND APPEND} option) is present then the file is
     * opened for reading. By default reading or writing commence at the

     *     therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
     *     with the {@code READ} or {@code TRUNCATE_EXISTING} options. &lt;/td&gt;

     *   the file already exists or is a symbolic link. When creating a file the
     *   check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it
     *   does not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations.

     *   &lt;em&gt;best effort&lt;/em&gt; attempt to delete the file when closed by the
     *   {@link SeekableByteChannel#close close} method. If the {@code close}
     *   method is not invoked then a &lt;em&gt;best effort&lt;/em&gt; attempt is made to

     * after which, the file tree walk continues, by default, at the next
     * &lt;em&gt;sibling&lt;/em&gt; of the directory.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; Where the directory is opened successfully, then the entries in the
     * directory, and their &lt;em&gt;descendants&lt;/em&gt; are visited. When all entries
     * have been visited, or an I/O error occurs during iteration of the
     * directory, then the directory is closed and the visitor's {@link
     * FileVisitor#postVisitDirectory postVisitDirectory} method is invoked.
     * The file tree walk then continues, by default, at the next &lt;em&gt;sibling&lt;/em&gt;
     * of the directory.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
     * method. If the {@code options} parameter contains the {@link

     * &lt;p&gt; If the {@code options} parameter contains the {@link
     * FileVisitOption#FOLLOW_LINKS FOLLOW_LINKS} option then this method keeps
     * track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
     * arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
     * directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the {@link
     * java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes#fileKey file-key} of directories,
     * or if file keys are not available, by invoking the {@link #isSameFile
     * isSameFile} method to test if a directory is the same file as an
     * ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error, and the
     * {@link FileVisitor#visitFileFailed visitFileFailed} method is invoked with
     * an instance of {@link FileSystemLoopException}.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; The {@code maxDepth} parameter is the maximum number of levels of
     * directories to visit. A value of {@code 0} means that only the starting
     * file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of
     * {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE MAX_VALUE} may be used to indicate that all
     * levels should be visited. The {@code visitFile} method is invoked for all
     * files, including directories, encountered at {@code maxDepth}, unless the
