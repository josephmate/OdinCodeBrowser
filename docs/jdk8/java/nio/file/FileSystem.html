/**
 * Provides an interface to a file system and is the factory for objects to
 * access files and other objects in the file system.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The default file system, obtained by invoking the {@link FileSystems#getDefault
 * FileSystems.getDefault} method, provides access to the file system that is
 * accessible to the Java virtual machine. The {@link FileSystems} class defines
 * methods to create file systems that provide access to other types of (custom)
 * file systems.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A file system is the factory for several types of objects:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getPath getPath} method converts a system dependent
 *     &lt;em&gt;path string&lt;/em&gt;, returning a {@link Path} object that may be used
 *     to locate and access a file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getPathMatcher  getPathMatcher} method is used
 *     to create a {@link PathMatcher} that performs match operations on
 *     paths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getFileStores getFileStores} method returns an iterator
 *     over the underlying {@link FileStore file-stores}. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getUserPrincipalLookupService getUserPrincipalLookupService}
 *     method returns the {@link UserPrincipalLookupService} to lookup users or
 *     groups by name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #newWatchService newWatchService} method creates a
 *     {@link WatchService} that may be used to watch objects for changes and
 *     events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; File systems vary greatly. In some cases the file system is a single
 * hierarchy of files with one top-level root directory. In other cases it may
 * have several distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level root
 * directory. The {@link #getRootDirectories getRootDirectories} method may be
 * used to iterate over the root directories in the file system. A file system
 * is typically composed of one or more underlying {@link FileStore file-stores}
 * that provide the storage for the files. Theses file stores can also vary in
 * the features they support, and the file attributes or &lt;em&gt;meta-data&lt;/em&gt; that
 * they associate with files.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A file system is open upon creation and can be closed by invoking its
 * {@link #close() close} method. Once closed, any further attempt to access
 * objects in the file system cause {@link ClosedFileSystemException} to be
 * thrown. File systems created by the default {@link FileSystemProvider provider}
 * cannot be closed.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A {@code FileSystem} can provide read-only or read-write access to the
 * file system. Whether or not a file system provides read-only access is
 * established when the {@code FileSystem} is created and can be tested by invoking
 * its {@link #isReadOnly() isReadOnly} method. Attempts to write to file stores
 * by means of an object associated with a read-only file system throws {@link
 * ReadOnlyFileSystemException}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; File systems are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The {@link
 * #close close} method may be invoked at any time to close a file system but
 * whether a file system is &lt;i&gt;asynchronously closeable&lt;/i&gt; is provider specific
 * and therefore unspecified. In other words, if a thread is accessing an
 * object in a file system, and another thread invokes the {@code close} method
 * then it may require to block until the first operation is complete. Closing
 * a file system causes all open channels, watch services, and other {@link
 * Closeable closeable} objects associated with the file system to be closed.

     * to convert. If {@code more} specifies one or more elements then each
     * non-empty string, including {@code first}, is considered to be a sequence
     * of name elements (see {@link Path}) and is joined to form a path string.
     * The details as to how the Strings are joined is provider specific but
     * typically they will be joined using the {@link #getSeparator
     * name-separator} as the separator. For example, if the name separator is
     * &quot;{@code /}&quot; and {@code getPath(&quot;/foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;gus&quot;)} is invoked, then the
     * path string {@code &quot;/foo/bar/gus&quot;} is converted to a {@code Path}.
     * A {@code Path} representing an empty path is returned if {@code first}
     * is the empty string and {@code more} does not contain any non-empty
     * strings.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; The parsing and conversion to a path object is inherently
     * implementation dependent. In the simplest case, the path string is rejected,
     * and {@link InvalidPathException} thrown, if the path string contains
     * characters that cannot be converted to characters that are &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt;
     * to the file store. For example, on UNIX systems, the NUL (&amp;#92;u0000)
     * character is not allowed to be present in a path. An implementation may
     * choose to reject path strings that contain names that are longer than those
     * allowed by any file store, and where an implementation supports a complex
     * path syntax, it may choose to reject path strings that are &lt;em&gt;badly
     * formed&lt;/em&gt;.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; In the case of the default provider, path strings are parsed based
     * on the definition of paths at the platform or virtual file system level.
     * For example, an operating system may not allow specific characters to be
     * present in a file name, but a specific underlying file store may impose
     * different or additional restrictions on the set of legal
     * characters.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; This method throws {@link InvalidPathException} when the path string
     * cannot be converted to a path. Where possible, and where applicable,
     * the exception is created with an {@link InvalidPathException#getIndex
     * index} value indicating the first position in the {@code path} parameter
     * that caused the path string to be rejected.

     *   platform (note that the backslash is escaped; as a string literal in the
     *   Java Language the pattern would be &lt;tt&gt;&quot;C:&amp;#92;&amp;#92;&amp;#92;&amp;#92;*&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;) &lt;/td&gt;
     * &lt;/tr&gt;
     *
     * &lt;/table&gt;
     * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:
     *
     * &lt;ul&gt;
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code *} character matches zero or more {@link Character
     *   characters} of a {@link Path#getName(int) name} component without
     *   crossing directory boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code **} characters matches zero or more {@link Character
     *   characters} crossing directory boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code ?} character matches exactly one character of a
     *   name component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The backslash character ({@code \}) is used to escape characters
     *   that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression
     *   {@code \\} matches a single backslash and &quot;\{&quot; matches a left brace
     *   for example.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code [ ]} characters are a &lt;i&gt;bracket expression&lt;/i&gt; that
     *   match a single character of a name component out of a set of characters.
     *   For example, {@code [abc]} matches {@code &quot;a&quot;}, {@code &quot;b&quot;}, or {@code &quot;c&quot;}.
     *   The hyphen ({@code -}) may be used to specify a range so {@code [a-z]}
     *   specifies a range that matches from {@code &quot;a&quot;} to {@code &quot;z&quot;} (inclusive).
     *   These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches {@code &quot;a&quot;}, {@code &quot;b&quot;},
     *   {@code &quot;c&quot;}, {@code &quot;e&quot;}, {@code &quot;f&quot;} or {@code &quot;g&quot;}. If the character
     *   after the {@code [} is a {@code !} then it is used for negation so {@code
     *   [!a-c]} matches any character except {@code &quot;a&quot;}, {@code &quot;b&quot;}, or {@code
     *   &quot;c&quot;}.
     *   &lt;p&gt; Within a bracket expression the {@code *}, {@code ?} and {@code \}
     *   characters match themselves. The ({@code -}) character matches itself if
     *   it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character
     *   after the {@code !} if negating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code { }} characters are a group of subpatterns, where
     *   the group matches if any subpattern in the group matches. The {@code &quot;,&quot;}
     *   character is used to separate the subpatterns. Groups cannot be nested.
     *   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leading period&lt;tt&gt;&amp;#47;&lt;/tt&gt;dot characters in file name are
     *   treated as regular characters in match operations. For example,
     *   the {@code &quot;*&quot;} glob pattern matches file name {@code &quot;.login&quot;}.
     *   The {@link Files#isHidden} method may be used to test whether a file
     *   is considered hidden.
     *   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; All other characters match themselves in an implementation
     *   dependent manner. This includes characters representing any {@link
     *   FileSystem#getSeparator name-separators}. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The matching of {@link Path#getRoot root} components is highly
     *   implementation-dependent and is not specified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
     *
     * &lt;/ul&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt; When the syntax is &quot;{@code regex}&quot; then the pattern component is a
     * regular expression as defined by the {@link java.util.regex.Pattern}
     * class.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;  For both the glob and regex syntaxes, the matching details, such as
     * whether the matching is case sensitive, are implementation-dependent
     * and therefore not specified.
