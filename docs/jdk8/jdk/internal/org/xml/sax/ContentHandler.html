/**
 * Receive notification of the logical content of a document.

 * &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 * Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
 * See &lt;a href='http://www.saxproject.org'&gt;http://www.saxproject.org&lt;/a&gt;
 * for further information.
 * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This is the main interface that most SAX applications
 * implement: if the application needs to be informed of basic parsing
 * events, it implements this interface and registers an instance with
 * the SAX parser using the {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader#setContentHandler
 * setContentHandler} method.  The parser uses the instance to report
 * basic document-related events like the start and end of elements
 * and character data.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The order of events in this interface is very important, and
 * mirrors the order of information in the document itself.  For
 * example, all of an element's content (character data, processing
 * instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between
 * the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface is similar to the now-deprecated SAX 1.0
 * DocumentHandler interface, but it adds support for Namespaces
 * and for reporting skipped entities (in non-validating XML
 * processors).&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Implementors should note that there is also a
 * &lt;code&gt;ContentHandler&lt;/code&gt; class in the &lt;code&gt;java.net&lt;/code&gt;
 * package; that means that it's probably a bad idea to do&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;import java.net.*;
 * import org.xml.sax.*;
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In fact, &quot;import ...*&quot; is usually a sign of sloppy programming
 * anyway, so the user should consider this a feature rather than a
 * bug.&lt;/p&gt;
