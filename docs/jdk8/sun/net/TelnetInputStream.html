/**
 * This class provides input and output streams for telnet clients.
 * This class overrides read to do CRLF processing as specified in
 * RFC 854. The class assumes it is running on a system where lines
 * are terminated with a single newline &lt;LF&gt; character.
 *
 * This is the relevant section of RFC 824 regarding CRLF processing:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * The sequence &quot;CR LF&quot;, as defined, will cause the NVT to be
 * positioned at the left margin of the next print line (as would,
 * for example, the sequence &quot;LF CR&quot;).  However, many systems and
 * terminals do not treat CR and LF independently, and will have to
 * go to some effort to simulate their effect.  (For example, some
 * terminals do not have a CR independent of the LF, but on such
 * terminals it may be possible to simulate a CR by backspacing.)
 * Therefore, the sequence &quot;CR LF&quot; must be treated as a single &quot;new
 * line&quot; character and used whenever their combined action is
 * intended; the sequence &quot;CR NUL&quot; must be used where a carriage
 * return alone is actually desired; and the CR character must be
 * avoided in other contexts.  This rule gives assurance to systems
 * which must decide whether to perform a &quot;new line&quot; function or a
 * multiple-backspace that the TELNET stream contains a character
 * following a CR that will allow a rational decision.
 *
 *    Note that &quot;CR LF&quot; or &quot;CR NUL&quot; is required in both directions
 *    (in the default ASCII mode), to preserve the symmetry of the
 *    NVT model.  Even though it may be known in some situations
 *    (e.g., with remote echo and suppress go ahead options in
 *    effect) that characters are not being sent to an actual
 *    printer, nonetheless, for the sake of consistency, the protocol
 *    requires that a NUL be inserted following a CR not followed by
 *    a LF in the data stream.  The converse of this is that a NUL
 *    received in the data stream after a CR (in the absence of
 *    options negotiations which explicitly specify otherwise) should
 *    be stripped out prior to applying the NVT to local character
 *    set mapping.
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
