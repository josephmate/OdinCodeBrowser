/**
 * An AdjacencyList is used to store the history of certification paths
 * attempted in constructing a path from an initiator to a target. The
 * AdjacencyList is initialized with a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; of
 * &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;s, where each sub-&lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; contains objects of
 * type &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt; describes one possible or
 * actual step in the chain building process, and the associated
 * &lt;code&gt;Certificate&lt;/code&gt;. Specifically, a &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt; object
 * contains a &lt;code&gt;Certificate&lt;/code&gt; and an index value referencing the
 * next sub-list in the process. If the index value is -1 then this
 * &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt; doesn't continue the attempted build path.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Example:
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Attempted Paths:&lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;C1-&amp;gt;C2-&amp;gt;C3
 * &lt;li&gt;C1-&amp;gt;C4-&amp;gt;C5
 * &lt;li&gt;C1-&amp;gt;C4-&amp;gt;C6
 * &lt;li&gt;C1-&amp;gt;C4-&amp;gt;C7
 * &lt;li&gt;C1-&amp;gt;C8-&amp;gt;C9
 * &lt;li&gt;C1-&amp;gt;C10-&amp;gt;C11
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * AdjacencyList structure:&lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;AL[0] = C1,1
 * &lt;li&gt;AL[1] = C2,2   =&amp;gt;C4,3   =&amp;gt;C8,4     =&amp;gt;C10,5
 * &lt;li&gt;AL[2] = C3,-1
 * &lt;li&gt;AL[3] = C5,-1  =&amp;gt;C6,-1  =&amp;gt;C7,-1
 * &lt;li&gt;AL[4] = C9,-1
 * &lt;li&gt;AL[5] = C11,-1
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The iterator method returns objects of type &lt;code&gt;BuildStep&lt;/code&gt;, not
 * objects of type &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt;.
 * A &lt;code&gt;BuildStep&lt;/code&gt; contains a &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt; and a result code,
 * accessible via getResult method. There are five result values.
 * &lt;code&gt;POSSIBLE&lt;/code&gt; denotes that the current step represents a
 * &lt;code&gt;Certificate&lt;/code&gt; that the builder is considering at this point in
 * the build. &lt;code&gt;FOLLOW&lt;/code&gt; denotes a &lt;code&gt;Certificate&lt;/code&gt; (one of
 * those noted as &lt;code&gt;POSSIBLE&lt;/code&gt;) that the builder is using to try
 * extending the chain. &lt;code&gt;BACK&lt;/code&gt; represents that a
 * &lt;code&gt;FOLLOW&lt;/code&gt; was incorrect, and is being removed from the chain.
 * There is exactly one &lt;code&gt;FOLLOW&lt;/code&gt; for each &lt;code&gt;BACK&lt;/code&gt;. The
 * values &lt;code&gt;SUCCEED&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FAIL&lt;/code&gt; mean that we've come to
 * the end of the build process, and there will not be any more entries in
 * the list.
