/**
 * This class implements a Berkeley uu character decoder. This decoder
 * was made famous by the uudecode program.
 *
 * The basic character coding is algorithmic, taking 6 bits of binary
 * data and adding it to an ASCII ' ' (space) character. This converts
 * these six bits into a printable representation. Note that it depends
 * on the ASCII character encoding standard for english. Groups of three
 * bytes are converted into 4 characters by treating the three bytes
 * a four 6 bit groups, group 1 is byte 1's most significant six bits,
 * group 2 is byte 1's least significant two bits plus byte 2's four
 * most significant bits. etc.
 *
 * In this encoding, the buffer prefix is:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     begin [mode] [filename]
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * This is followed by one or more lines of the form:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *      (len)(data)(data)(data) ...
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * where (len) is the number of bytes on this line. Note that groupings
 * are always four characters, even if length is not a multiple of three
 * bytes. When less than three characters are encoded, the values of the
 * last remaining bytes is undefined and should be ignored.
 *
 * The last line of data in a uuencoded buffer is represented by a single
 * space character. This is translated by the decoding engine to a line
 * length of zero. This is immediately followed by a line which contains
 * the word 'end[newline]'
 *
 * If an error is encountered during decoding this class throws a
 * CEFormatException. The specific detail messages are:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *      &quot;UUDecoder: No begin line.&quot;
 *      &quot;UUDecoder: Malformed begin line.&quot;
 *      &quot;UUDecoder: Short Buffer.&quot;
 *      &quot;UUDecoder: Bad Line Length.&quot;
 *      &quot;UUDecoder: Missing 'end' line.&quot;
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
