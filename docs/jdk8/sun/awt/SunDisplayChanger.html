/**
 * This class is used to aid in keeping track of DisplayChangedListeners and
 * notifying them when a display change has taken place. DisplayChangedListeners
 * are notified when the display's bit depth is changed, or when a top-level
 * window has been dragged onto another screen.
 *
 * It is safe for a DisplayChangedListener to be added while the list is being
 * iterated.
 *
 * The displayChanged() call is propagated after some occurrence (either
 * due to user action or some other application) causes the display mode
 * (e.g., depth or resolution) to change.  All heavyweight components need
 * to know when this happens because they need to create new surfaceData
 * objects based on the new depth.
 *
 * displayChanged() is also called on Windows when they are moved from one
 * screen to another on a system equipped with multiple displays.
