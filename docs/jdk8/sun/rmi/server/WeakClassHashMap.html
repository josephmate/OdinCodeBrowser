/**
 * Abstract class that maps Class objects to lazily-computed values of
 * type V.  A concrete subclass must implement the computeValue method
 * to determine how the values are computed.
 *
 * The keys are only weakly reachable through this map, so this map
 * does not prevent a class (along with its class loader, etc.) from
 * being garbage collected if it is not otherwise strongly reachable.
 * The values are only softly reachable through this map, so that the
 * computed values generally persist while not otherwise strongly
 * reachable, but their storage may be reclaimed if necessary.  Also,
 * note that if a key is strongly reachable from a value, then the key
 * is effectively softly reachable through this map, which may delay
 * garbage collection of classes (see 4429536).
