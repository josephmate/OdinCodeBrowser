/**
 * This class serves as a factory for other important
 * GSS-API classes and also provides information about the mechanisms that
 * are supported. It can create instances of classes
 * implementing the following three GSS-API interfaces: {@link
 * GSSName GSSName}, {@link GSSCredential GSSCredential}, and {@link
 * GSSContext GSSContext}. It also has methods to query for the list
 * of available mechanisms and the nametypes that each mechanism
 * supports.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * An instance of the default &lt;code&gt;GSSManager&lt;/code&gt; subclass
 * may be obtained through the static method {@link #getInstance()
 * getInstance}, but applications are free to instantiate other subclasses
 * of &lt;code&gt;GSSManager&lt;/code&gt;. The default &lt;code&gt;GSSManager&lt;/code&gt; instance
 * will support the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism in addition to any
 * others. This mechanism is identified by the Oid &quot;1.2.840.113554.1.2.2&quot;
 * and is defined in RFC 1964.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * A subclass extending the &lt;code&gt;GSSManager&lt;/code&gt; abstract class may be
 * implemented  as a modular provider based layer that utilizes some well
 * known  service provider specification. The &lt;code&gt;GSSManager&lt;/code&gt; API
 * allows the application to set provider preferences on
 * such an implementation. These methods also allow the implementation to
 * throw a well-defined exception in case provider based configuration is
 * not supported. Applications that expect to be portable should be aware
 * of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which
 * providers will be used:&lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt; The application does not care about what provider is used (the
 * default case).
 * &lt;li&gt; The application wants a particular provider to be used
 * preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the
 * time, irrespective of mechanism.
 * &lt;li&gt; The application wants to use the locally configured providers
 * as far as possible but if support is missing for one or more
 * mechanisms then it wants to fall back on its own provider.
 *&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The &lt;code&gt;GSSManager&lt;/code&gt; class has two methods that enable these modes of
 * usage:  {@link #addProviderAtFront(Provider, Oid) addProviderAtFront} and
 * {@link #addProviderAtEnd(Provider, Oid) addProviderAtEnd}. These methods
 * have the effect of creating an ordered list of &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;provider,
 * oid&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt; pairs  where each pair indicates a preference of provider
 * for a given oid.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * It is important to note that there are certain interactions
 * between the different GSS-API objects that are created by a
 * GSSManager, where the provider that is used for a particular mechanism
 * might need to be consistent across all objects. For instance, if a
 * GSSCredential contains elements from a provider &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for a mechanism
 * &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;, it should generally be passed in to a GSSContext that will use
 * provider &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for the mechanism &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;. A simple rule of thumb
 * that will maximize portability is that objects created from different
 * GSSManager's should not be mixed, and if possible, a different
 * GSSManager instance should be created if the application wants to invoke
 * the &lt;code&gt;addProviderAtFront&lt;/code&gt; method on a GSSManager that has
 * already created an object.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 *  Here is some sample code showing how the GSSManager might be used: &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();
 *
 *     Oid krb5Mechanism = new Oid(&quot;1.2.840.113554.1.2.2&quot;);
 *     Oid krb5PrincipalNameType = new Oid(&quot;1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1&quot;);
 *
 *     // Identify who the client wishes to be
 *     GSSName userName = manager.createName(&quot;duke&quot;, GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);
 *
 *     // Identify the name of the server. This uses a Kerberos specific
 *     // name format.
 *     GSSName serverName = manager.createName(&quot;nfs/foo.sun.com&quot;,
 *                                             krb5PrincipalNameType);
 *
 *     // Acquire credentials for the user
 *     GSSCredential userCreds = manager.createCredential(userName,
 *                                             GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
 *                                             krb5Mechanism,
 *                                             GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY);
 *
 *     // Instantiate and initialize a security context that will be
 *     // established with the server
 *     GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverName,
 *                                                krb5Mechanism,
 *                                                userCreds,
 *                                                GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The server side might use the following variation of this source:&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     // Acquire credentials for the server
 *     GSSCredential serverCreds = manager.createCredential(serverName,
 *                                             GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
 *                                             krb5Mechanism,
 *                                             GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);
 *
 *     // Instantiate and initialize a security context that will
 *     // wait for an establishment request token from the client
 *     GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverCreds);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
