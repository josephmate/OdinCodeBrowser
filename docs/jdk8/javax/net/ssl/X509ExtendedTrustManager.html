/**
 * Extensions to the &lt;code&gt;X509TrustManager&lt;/code&gt; interface to support
 * SSL/TLS connection sensitive trust management.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, hostname checks can be done
 * to verify that the hostname in an end-entity certificate matches the
 * targeted hostname.  TLS does not require such checks, but some protocols
 * over TLS (such as HTTPS) do.  In earlier versions of the JDK, the
 * certificate chain checks were done at the SSL/TLS layer, and the hostname
 * verification checks were done at the layer over TLS.  This class allows
 * for the checking to be done during a single call to this class.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * RFC 2830 defines the server identification specification for the &quot;LDAPS&quot;
 * algorithm. RFC 2818 defines both the server identification and the
 * client identification specification for the &quot;HTTPS&quot; algorithm.
