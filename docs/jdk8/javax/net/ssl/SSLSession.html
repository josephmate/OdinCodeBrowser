/**
 * In SSL, sessions are used to describe an ongoing relationship between
 * two entities.  Each SSL connection involves one session at a time, but
 * that session may be used on many connections between those entities,
 * simultaneously or sequentially.  The session used on a connection may
 * also be replaced by a different session.  Sessions are created, or
 * rejoined, as part of the SSL handshaking protocol. Sessions may be
 * invalidated due to policies affecting security or resource usage,
 * or by an application explicitly calling &lt;code&gt;invalidate&lt;/code&gt;.
 * Session management policies are typically used to tune performance.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; In addition to the standard session attributes, SSL sessions expose
 * these read-only attributes:  &lt;UL&gt;
 *
 *      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Peer Identity.&lt;/em&gt;  Sessions are between a particular
 *      client and a particular server.  The identity of the peer may
 *      have been established as part of session setup.  Peers are
 *      generally identified by X.509 certificate chains.
 *
 *      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cipher Suite Name.&lt;/em&gt;  Cipher suites describe the
 *      kind of cryptographic protection that's used by connections
 *      in a particular session.
 *
 *      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Peer Host.&lt;/em&gt;  All connections in a session are
 *      between the same two hosts.  The address of the host on the other
 *      side of the connection is available.
 *
 *      &lt;/UL&gt;
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; Sessions may be explicitly invalidated.  Invalidation may also
 * be done implicitly, when faced with certain kinds of errors.
