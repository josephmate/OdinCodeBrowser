 * This class defines the &lt;i&gt;Service Provider Interface&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;b&gt;SPI&lt;/b&gt;)
 * for the &lt;code&gt;SecretKeyFactory&lt;/code&gt; class.
 * All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 * cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 * of a secret-key factory for a particular algorithm.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; A provider should document all the key specifications supported by its
 * secret key factory.
 * For example, the DES secret-key factory supplied by the &quot;SunJCE&quot; provider
 * supports &lt;code&gt;DESKeySpec&lt;/code&gt; as a transparent representation of DES
 * keys, and that provider's secret-key factory for Triple DES keys supports
 * &lt;code&gt;DESedeKeySpec&lt;/code&gt; as a transparent representation of Triple DES
 * keys.
