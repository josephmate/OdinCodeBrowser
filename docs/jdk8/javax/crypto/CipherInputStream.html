/**
 * A CipherInputStream is composed of an InputStream and a Cipher so
 * that read() methods return data that are read in from the
 * underlying InputStream but have been additionally processed by the
 * Cipher.  The Cipher must be fully initialized before being used by
 * a CipherInputStream.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; For example, if the Cipher is initialized for decryption, the
 * CipherInputStream will attempt to read in data and decrypt them,
 * before returning the decrypted data.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; This class adheres strictly to the semantics, especially the
 * failure semantics, of its ancestor classes
 * java.io.FilterInputStream and java.io.InputStream.  This class has
 * exactly those methods specified in its ancestor classes, and
 * overrides them all.  Moreover, this class catches all exceptions
 * that are not thrown by its ancestor classes.  In particular, the
 * &lt;code&gt;skip&lt;/code&gt; method skips, and the &lt;code&gt;available&lt;/code&gt;
 * method counts only data that have been processed by the encapsulated Cipher.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; It is crucial for a programmer using this class not to use
 * methods that are not defined or overriden in this class (such as a
 * new method or constructor that is later added to one of the super
 * classes), because the design and implementation of those methods
 * are unlikely to have considered security impact with regard to
 * CipherInputStream.
