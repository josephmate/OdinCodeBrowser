   * object must have implemented the &lt;code&gt;RowSetInternal&lt;/code&gt; interface
   * and registered this &lt;code&gt;RowSetReader&lt;/code&gt; object as its reader.
   * The &lt;code&gt;readData&lt;/code&gt;  method is invoked internally
   * by the &lt;code&gt;RowSet.execute&lt;/code&gt; method for rowsets that support the
   * reader/writer paradigm.
   *
   * &lt;P&gt;The &lt;code&gt;readData&lt;/code&gt; method adds rows to the caller.
   * It can be implemented in a wide variety of ways and can even
   * populate the caller with rows from a nonrelational data source.
   * In general, a reader may invoke any of the rowset's methods,
   * with one exception. Calling the method &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; will
   * cause an &lt;code&gt;SQLException&lt;/code&gt; to be thrown

   * are notified; that is, no &lt;code&gt;RowSetEvent&lt;/code&gt; objects are
   * generated and no &lt;code&gt;RowSetListener&lt;/code&gt; methods are invoked.
   * This is true because listeners are already being notified by the method
   * &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;.

   *        registered, and (3) whose &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; method called this reader
   * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs or this method
   *            invokes the &lt;code&gt;RowSet.execute&lt;/code&gt; method
