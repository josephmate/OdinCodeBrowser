 * An object that registers to be notified of events generated by a
 * &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt; interface is implemented by a
 * connection pooling component.  A connection pooling component will
 * usually be provided by a JDBC driver vendor or another system software
 * vendor.  A JDBC driver notifies a &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * object when an application is finished using a pooled connection with
 * which the listener has registered.  The notification
 * occurs after the application calls the method &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; on
 * its representation of a &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.  A
 * &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt; is also notified when a
 * connection error occurs due to the fact that the &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt;
 * is unfit for future use---the server has crashed, for example.
 * The listener is notified by the JDBC driver just before the driver throws an
 * &lt;code&gt;SQLException&lt;/code&gt; to the application using the
 * &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.
