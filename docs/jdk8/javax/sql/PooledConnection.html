/**
 * An object that provides hooks for connection pool management.
 * A &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object
 * represents a physical connection to a data source.  The connection
 * can be recycled rather than being closed when an application is
 * finished with it, thus reducing the number of connections that
 * need to be made.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * An application programmer does not use the &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt;
 * interface directly; rather, it is used by a middle tier infrastructure
 * that manages the pooling of connections.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * When an application calls the method &lt;code&gt;DataSource.getConnection&lt;/code&gt;,
 * it gets back a &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; object.  If connection pooling is
 * being done, that &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; object is actually a handle to
 * a &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object, which is a physical connection.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The connection pool manager, typically the application server, maintains
 * a pool of &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; objects.  If there is a
 * &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object available in the pool, the
 * connection pool manager returns a &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; object that
 * is a handle to that physical connection.
 * If no &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object is available, the
 * connection pool manager calls the &lt;code&gt;ConnectionPoolDataSource&lt;/code&gt;
 * method &lt;code&gt;getPoolConnection&lt;/code&gt; to create a new physical connection.  The
 *  JDBC driver implementing &lt;code&gt;ConnectionPoolDataSource&lt;/code&gt; creates a
 *  new &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object and returns a handle to it.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * When an application closes a connection, it calls the &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt;
 * method &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;. When connection pooling is being done,
 * the connection pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
 * a &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt; object using the
 * &lt;code&gt;ConnectionPool&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;addConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt;.
 * The connection pool manager deactivates the handle to
 * the &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object and  returns the
 * &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object to the pool of connections so that
 * it can be used again.  Thus, when an application closes its connection,
 * the underlying physical connection is recycled rather than being closed.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The physical connection is not closed until the connection pool manager
 * calls the &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;.
 * This method is generally called to have an orderly shutdown of the server or
 * if a fatal error has made the connection unusable.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A connection pool manager is often also a statement pool manager, maintaining
 *  a pool of &lt;code&gt;PreparedStatement&lt;/code&gt; objects.
 *  When an application closes a prepared statement, it calls the
 *  &lt;code&gt;PreparedStatement&lt;/code&gt;
 * method &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;. When &lt;code&gt;Statement&lt;/code&gt; pooling is being done,
 * the pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
 * a &lt;code&gt;StatementEventListener&lt;/code&gt; object using the
 * &lt;code&gt;ConnectionPool&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;addStatementEventListener&lt;/code&gt;.
 *  Thus, when an application closes its  &lt;code&gt;PreparedStatement&lt;/code&gt;,
 * the underlying prepared statement is recycled rather than being closed.
 * &lt;P&gt;
