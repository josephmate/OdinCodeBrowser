/**
 * A &lt;code&gt;Soundbank&lt;/code&gt; contains a set of &lt;code&gt;Instruments&lt;/code&gt;
 * that can be loaded into a &lt;code&gt;Synthesizer&lt;/code&gt;.
 * Note that a Java Sound &lt;code&gt;Soundbank&lt;/code&gt; is different from a MIDI bank.
 * MIDI permits up to 16383 banks, each containing up to 128 instruments
 * (also sometimes called programs, patches, or timbres).
 * However, a &lt;code&gt;Soundbank&lt;/code&gt; can contain 16383 times 128 instruments,
 * because the instruments within a &lt;code&gt;Soundbank&lt;/code&gt; are indexed by both
 * a MIDI program number and a MIDI bank number (via a &lt;code&gt;Patch&lt;/code&gt;
 * object). Thus, a &lt;code&gt;Soundbank&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as a collection
 * of MIDI banks.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;code&gt;Soundbank&lt;/code&gt; includes methods that return &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;
 * objects containing the sound bank's name, manufacturer, version number, and
 * description.  The precise content and format of these strings is left
 * to the implementor.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Different synthesizers use a variety of synthesis techniques.  A common
 * one is wavetable synthesis, in which a segment of recorded sound is
 * played back, often with looping and pitch change.  The Downloadable Sound
 * (DLS) format uses segments of recorded sound, as does the Headspace Engine.
 * &lt;code&gt;Soundbanks&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Instruments&lt;/code&gt; that are based on
 * wavetable synthesis (or other uses of stored sound recordings) should
 * typically implement the &lt;code&gt;getResources()&lt;/code&gt;
 * method to provide access to these recorded segments.  This is optional,
 * however; the method can return an zero-length array if the synthesis technique
 * doesn't use sampled sound (FM synthesis and physical modeling are examples
 * of such techniques), or if it does but the implementor chooses not to make the
 * samples accessible.
