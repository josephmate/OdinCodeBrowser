/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;ReverbType&lt;/code&gt; class provides methods for
 * accessing various reverberation settings to be applied to
 * an audio signal.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Reverberation simulates the reflection of sound off of
 * the walls, ceiling, and floor of a room.  Depending on
 * the size of the room, and how absorbent or reflective the materials in the
 * room's surfaces are, the sound might bounce around for a
 * long time before dying away.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The reverberation parameters provided by &lt;code&gt;ReverbType&lt;/code&gt; consist
 * of the delay time and intensity of early reflections, the delay time and
 * intensity of late reflections, and an overall decay time.
 * Early reflections are the initial individual low-order reflections of the
 * direct signal off the surfaces in the room.
 * The late Reflections are the dense, high-order reflections that characterize
 * the room's reverberation.
 * The delay times for the start of these two reflection types give the listener
 * a sense of the overall size and complexity of the room's shape and contents.
 * The larger the room, the longer the reflection delay times.
 * The early and late reflections' intensities define the gain (in decibels) of the reflected
 * signals as compared to the direct signal.  These intensities give the
 * listener an impression of the absorptive nature of the surfaces and objects
 * in the room.
 * The decay time defines how long the reverberation takes to exponentially
 * decay until it is no longer perceptible (&quot;effective zero&quot;).
 * The larger and less absorbent the surfaces, the longer the decay time.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The set of parameters defined here may not include all aspects of reverberation
 * as specified by some systems.  For example, the Midi Manufacturer's Association
 * (MMA) has an Interactive Audio Special Interest Group (IASIG), which has a
 * 3-D Working Group that has defined a Level 2 Spec (I3DL2).  I3DL2
 * supports filtering of reverberation and
 * control of reverb density.  These properties are not included in the JavaSound 1.0
 * definition of a reverb control.  In such a case, the implementing system
 * should either extend the defined reverb control to include additional
 * parameters, or else interpret the system's additional capabilities in a way that fits
 * the model described here.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If implementing JavaSound on a I3DL2-compliant device:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Filtering is disabled (high-frequency attenuations are set to 0.0 dB)
 * &lt;li&gt;Density parameters are set to midway between minimum and maximum
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The following table shows what parameter values an implementation might use for a
 * representative set of reverberation settings.
 * &lt;p&gt;
