/**
 * &lt;code&gt;DataLine&lt;/code&gt; adds media-related functionality to its
 * superinterface, &lt;code&gt;{@link Line}&lt;/code&gt;.  This functionality includes
 * transport-control methods that start, stop, drain, and flush
 * the audio data that passes through the line.  A data line can also
 * report the current position, volume, and audio format of the media.
 * Data lines are used for output of audio by means of the
 * subinterfaces &lt;code&gt;{@link SourceDataLine}&lt;/code&gt; or
 * &lt;code&gt;{@link Clip}&lt;/code&gt;, which allow an application program to write data.  Similarly,
 * audio input is handled by the subinterface &lt;code&gt;{@link TargetDataLine}&lt;/code&gt;,
 * which allows data to be read.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A data line has an internal buffer in which
 * the incoming or outgoing audio data is queued.  The
 * &lt;code&gt;{@link #drain()}&lt;/code&gt; method blocks until this internal buffer
 * becomes empty, usually because all queued data has been processed.  The
 * &lt;code&gt;{@link #flush()}&lt;/code&gt; method discards any available queued data
 * from the internal buffer.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A data line produces &lt;code&gt;{@link LineEvent.Type#START START}&lt;/code&gt; and
 * &lt;code&gt;{@link LineEvent.Type#STOP STOP}&lt;/code&gt; events whenever
 * it begins or ceases active presentation or capture of data.  These events
 * can be generated in response to specific requests, or as a result of
 * less direct state changes.  For example, if &lt;code&gt;{@link #start()}&lt;/code&gt; is called
 * on an inactive data line, and data is available for capture or playback, a
 * &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt; event will be generated shortly, when data playback
 * or capture actually begins.  Or, if the flow of data to an active data
 * line is constricted so that a gap occurs in the presentation of data,
 * a &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt; event is generated.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Mixers often support synchronized control of multiple data lines.
 * Synchronization can be established through the Mixer interface's
 * &lt;code&gt;{@link Mixer#synchronize synchronize}&lt;/code&gt; method.
 * See the description of the &lt;code&gt;{@link Mixer Mixer}&lt;/code&gt; interface
 * for a more complete description.
