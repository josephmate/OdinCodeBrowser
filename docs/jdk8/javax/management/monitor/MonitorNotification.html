/**
 * Provides definitions of the notifications sent by monitor MBeans.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The notification source and a set of parameters concerning the monitor MBean's state
 * need to be specified when creating a new object of this class.
 *
 * The list of notifications fired by the monitor MBeans is the following:
 *
 * &lt;UL&gt;
 * &lt;LI&gt;Common to all kind of monitors:
 *     &lt;UL&gt;
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The observed object is not registered in the MBean server.
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The observed attribute is not contained in the observed object.
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The type of the observed attribute is not correct.
 *     &lt;LI&gt;Any exception (except the cases described above) occurs when trying to get the value of the observed attribute.
 *     &lt;/UL&gt;
 * &lt;LI&gt;Common to the counter and the gauge monitors:
 *     &lt;UL&gt;
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The threshold high or threshold low are not of the same type as the gauge (gauge monitors).
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The threshold or the offset or the modulus are not of the same type as the counter (counter monitors).
 *     &lt;/UL&gt;
 * &lt;LI&gt;Counter monitors only:
 *     &lt;UL&gt;
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The observed attribute has reached the threshold value.
 *     &lt;/UL&gt;
 * &lt;LI&gt;Gauge monitors only:
 *     &lt;UL&gt;
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The observed attribute has exceeded the threshold high value.
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The observed attribute has exceeded the threshold low value.
 *     &lt;/UL&gt;
 * &lt;LI&gt;String monitors only:
 *     &lt;UL&gt;
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The observed attribute has matched the &quot;string to compare&quot; value.
 *     &lt;LI&gt;The observed attribute has differed from the &quot;string to compare&quot; value.
 *     &lt;/UL&gt;
