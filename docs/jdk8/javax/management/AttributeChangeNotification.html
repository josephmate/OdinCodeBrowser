/**
 * Provides definitions of the attribute change notifications sent by MBeans.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * It's up to the MBean owning the attribute of interest to create and send
 * attribute change notifications when the attribute change occurs.
 * So the &lt;CODE&gt;NotificationBroadcaster&lt;/CODE&gt; interface has to be implemented
 * by any MBean for which an attribute change is of interest.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Example:
 * If an MBean called &lt;CODE&gt;myMbean&lt;/CODE&gt; needs to notify registered listeners
 * when its attribute:
 * &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;
 *      String myString
 * &lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
 * is modified, &lt;CODE&gt;myMbean&lt;/CODE&gt; creates and emits the following notification:
 * &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;
 * new AttributeChangeNotification(myMbean, sequenceNumber, timeStamp, msg,
 *                                 &quot;myString&quot;, &quot;String&quot;, oldValue, newValue);
 * &lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

 * @since 1.5
