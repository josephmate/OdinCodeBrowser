/**
 * &lt;p&gt;Instances of this interface are used to keep the list of ClassLoaders
 * registered in an MBean Server.
 * They provide the necessary methods to load classes using the registered
 * ClassLoaders.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The first ClassLoader in a &lt;code&gt;ClassLoaderRepository&lt;/code&gt; is
 * always the MBean Server's own ClassLoader.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;When an MBean is registered in an MBean Server, if it is of a
 * subclass of {@link java.lang.ClassLoader} and if it does not
 * implement the interface {@link PrivateClassLoader}, it is added to
 * the end of the MBean Server's &lt;code&gt;ClassLoaderRepository&lt;/code&gt;.
 * If it is subsequently unregistered from the MBean Server, it is
 * removed from the &lt;code&gt;ClassLoaderRepository&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The order of MBeans in the &lt;code&gt;ClassLoaderRepository&lt;/code&gt; is
 * significant.  For any two MBeans &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; in the
 * &lt;code&gt;ClassLoaderRepository&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; must appear before
 * &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; if the registration of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; was completed before
 * the registration of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; started.  If &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and
 * &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; were registered concurrently, their order is
 * indeterminate.  The registration of an MBean corresponds to the
 * call to {@link MBeanServer#registerMBean} or one of the {@link
 * MBeanServer}&lt;code&gt;.createMBean&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
