 * &lt;P&gt;Class AccessibleRole determines the role of a component.  The role of a

 * &lt;p&gt;The toDisplayString method allows you to obtain the localized string

 * purposely omitted and applications should use one of the constants
 * from this class.  If the constants in this class are not sufficient
 * to describe the role of an object, a subclass should be generated
 * from this class and it should provide constants in a similar manner.
