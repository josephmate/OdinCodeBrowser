/**
  * This interface represents an LDAPv3 extended operation request as defined in
  * &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt&quot;&gt;RFC 2251&lt;/A&gt;.
  * &lt;pre&gt;
  *     ExtendedRequest ::= [APPLICATION 23] SEQUENCE {
  *              requestName      [0] LDAPOID,
  *              requestValue     [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }
  * &lt;/pre&gt;
  * It comprises an object identifier string and an optional ASN.1 BER
  * encoded value.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The methods in this class are used by the service provider to construct
  * the bits to send to the LDAP server. Applications typically only deal with
  * the classes that implement this interface, supplying them with
  * any information required for a particular extended operation request.
  * It would then pass such a class as an argument to the
  * &lt;tt&gt;LdapContext.extendedOperation()&lt;/tt&gt; method for performing the
  * LDAPv3 extended operation.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * For example, suppose the LDAP server supported a 'get time' extended operation.
  * It would supply GetTimeRequest and GetTimeResponse classes:
  *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
  * public class GetTimeRequest implements ExtendedRequest {
  *     public GetTimeRequest() {... };
  *     public ExtendedResponse createExtendedResponse(String id,
  *         byte[] berValue, int offset, int length)
  *         throws NamingException {
  *         return new GetTimeResponse(id, berValue, offset, length);
  *     }
  *     ...
  * }
  * public class GetTimeResponse implements ExtendedResponse {
  *     long time;
  *     public GetTimeResponse(String id, byte[] berValue, int offset,
  *         int length) throws NamingException {
  *         time =      ... // decode berValue to get time
  *     }
  *     public java.util.Date getDate() { return new java.util.Date(time) };
  *     public long getTime() { return time };
  *     ...
  * }
  *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  * A program would use then these classes as follows:
  *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
  * GetTimeResponse resp =
  *     (GetTimeResponse) ectx.extendedOperation(new GetTimeRequest());
  * long time = resp.getTime();
  *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
