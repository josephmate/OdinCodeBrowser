/**
 * This interface represents a context in which you can perform
 * operations with LDAPv3-style controls and perform LDAPv3-style
 * extended operations.
 *
 * For applications that do not require such controls or extended
 * operations, the more generic &lt;tt&gt;javax.naming.directory.DirContext&lt;/tt&gt;
 * should be used instead.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Usage Details About Controls&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * This interface provides support for LDAP v3 controls.
 * At a high level, this support allows a user
 * program to set request controls for LDAP operations that are executed
 * in the course of the user program's invocation of
 * &lt;tt&gt;Context&lt;/tt&gt;/&lt;tt&gt;DirContext&lt;/tt&gt;
 * methods, and read response controls resulting from LDAP operations.
 * At the implementation level, there are some details that developers of
 * both the user program and service providers need to understand in order
 * to correctly use request and response controls.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Request Controls&lt;/h3&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are two types of request controls:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Request controls that affect how a connection is created
 * &lt;li&gt;Request controls that affect context methods
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * The former is used whenever a connection needs to be established or
 * re-established with an LDAP server. The latter is used when all other
 * LDAP operations are sent to the LDAP server.  The reason why a
 * distinction between these two types of request controls is necessary
 * is because JNDI is a high-level API that does not deal directly with
 * connections.  It is the job of service providers to do any necessary
 * connection management. Consequently, a single
 * connection may be shared by multiple context instances, and a service provider
 * is free to use its own algorithms to conserve connection and network
 * usage. Thus, when a method is invoked on the context instance, the service
 * provider might need to do some connection management in addition to
 * performing the corresponding LDAP operations. For connection management,
 * it uses the &lt;em&gt;connection request controls&lt;/em&gt;, while for the normal
 * LDAP operations, it uses the &lt;em&gt;context request controls&lt;/em&gt;.
 *&lt;p&gt;Unless explicitly qualified, the term &quot;request controls&quot; refers to
 * context request controls.
 *
 * &lt;h4&gt;Context Request Controls&lt;/h4&gt;
 * There are two ways in which a context instance gets its request controls:
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;ldapContext.newInstance(&lt;strong&gt;reqCtls&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;ldapContext.setRequestControls(&lt;strong&gt;reqCtls&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * where &lt;tt&gt;ldapContext&lt;/tt&gt; is an instance of &lt;tt&gt;LdapContext&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * Specifying &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; or an empty array for &lt;tt&gt;reqCtls&lt;/tt&gt;
 * means no request controls.
 * &lt;tt&gt;newInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; creates a new instance of a context using
 * &lt;tt&gt;reqCtls&lt;/tt&gt;, while &lt;tt&gt;setRequestControls()&lt;/tt&gt;
 * updates an existing context instance's request controls to &lt;tt&gt;reqCtls&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Unlike environment properties, request controls of a context instance
 * &lt;em&gt;are not inherited&lt;/em&gt; by context instances that are derived from
 * it.  Derived context instances have &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; as their context
 * request controls.  You must set the request controls of a derived context
 * instance explicitly using &lt;tt&gt;setRequestControls()&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A context instance's request controls are retrieved using
 * the method &lt;tt&gt;getRequestControls()&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *
 * &lt;h4&gt;Connection Request Controls&lt;/h4&gt;
 * There are three ways in which connection request controls are set:
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
 * new InitialLdapContext(env, &lt;strong&gt;connCtls&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;refException.getReferralContext(env, &lt;strong&gt;connCtls&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;ldapContext.reconnect(&lt;strong&gt;connCtls&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;/tt&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * where &lt;tt&gt;refException&lt;/tt&gt; is an instance of
 * &lt;tt&gt;LdapReferralException&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;ldapContext&lt;/tt&gt; is an
 * instance of &lt;tt&gt;LdapContext&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * Specifying &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; or an empty array for &lt;tt&gt;connCtls&lt;/tt&gt;
 * means no connection request controls.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Like environment properties, connection request controls of a context
 * &lt;em&gt;are inherited&lt;/em&gt; by contexts that are derived from it.
 * Typically, you initialize the connection request controls using the
 * &lt;tt&gt;InitialLdapContext&lt;/tt&gt; constructor or
 * &lt;tt&gt;LdapReferralContext.getReferralContext()&lt;/tt&gt;. These connection
 * request controls are inherited by contexts that share the same
 * connection--that is, contexts derived from the initial or referral
 * contexts.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use &lt;tt&gt;reconnect()&lt;/tt&gt; to change the connection request controls of
 * a context.
 * Invoking &lt;tt&gt;ldapContext.reconnect()&lt;/tt&gt; affects only the
 * connection used by &lt;tt&gt;ldapContext&lt;/tt&gt; and any new contexts instances that are
 * derived form &lt;tt&gt;ldapContext&lt;/tt&gt;. Contexts that previously shared the
 * connection with &lt;tt&gt;ldapContext&lt;/tt&gt; remain unchanged. That is, a context's
 * connection request controls must be explicitly changed and is not
 * affected by changes to another context's connection request
 * controls.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A context instance's connection request controls are retrieved using
 * the method &lt;tt&gt;getConnectControls()&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *
 * &lt;h4&gt;Service Provider Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
 *
 * A service provider supports connection and context request controls
 * in the following ways.  Context request controls must be associated on
 * a per context instance basis while connection request controls must be
 * associated on a per connection instance basis.  The service provider
 * must look for the connection request controls in the environment
 * property &quot;java.naming.ldap.control.connect&quot; and pass this environment
 * property on to context instances that it creates.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Response Controls&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * The method &lt;tt&gt;LdapContext.getResponseControls()&lt;/tt&gt; is used to
 * retrieve the response controls generated by LDAP operations executed
 * as the result of invoking a &lt;tt&gt;Context&lt;/tt&gt;/&lt;tt&gt;DirContext&lt;/tt&gt;
 * operation. The result is all of the responses controls generated
 * by the underlying LDAP operations, including any implicit reconnection.
 * To get only the reconnection response controls,
 * use &lt;tt&gt;reconnect()&lt;/tt&gt; followed by &lt;tt&gt;getResponseControls()&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * A &lt;tt&gt;Control[]&lt;/tt&gt; array
 * passed as a parameter to any method is owned by the caller.
 * The service provider will not modify the array or keep a reference to it,
 * although it may keep references to the individual &lt;tt&gt;Control&lt;/tt&gt; objects
 * in the array.
 * A &lt;tt&gt;Control[]&lt;/tt&gt; array returned by any method is immutable, and may
 * not subsequently be modified by either the caller or the service provider.
