/**
 * This class represents a compound name -- a name from
 * a hierarchical name space.
 * Each component in a compound name is an atomic name.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The components of a compound name are numbered.  The indexes of a
 * compound name with N components range from 0 up to, but not including, N.
 * This range may be written as [0,N).
 * The most significant component is at index 0.
 * An empty compound name has no components.
 *
 * &lt;h1&gt;Compound Name Syntax&lt;/h1&gt;
 * The syntax of a compound name is specified using a set of properties:
 *&lt;dl&gt;
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.direction
 *  &lt;dd&gt;Direction for parsing (&quot;right_to_left&quot;, &quot;left_to_right&quot;, &quot;flat&quot;).
 *      If unspecified, defaults to &quot;flat&quot;, which means the namespace is flat
 *      with no hierarchical structure.
 *
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.separator
 *  &lt;dd&gt;Separator between atomic name components.
 *      Required unless direction is &quot;flat&quot;.
 *
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.ignorecase
 *  &lt;dd&gt;If present, &quot;true&quot; means ignore the case when comparing name
 *      components. If its value is not &quot;true&quot;, or if the property is not
 *      present, case is considered when comparing name components.
 *
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.escape
 *  &lt;dd&gt;If present, specifies the escape string for overriding separator,
 *      escapes and quotes.
 *
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.beginquote
 *  &lt;dd&gt;If present, specifies the string delimiting start of a quoted string.
 *
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.endquote
 *  &lt;dd&gt;String delimiting end of quoted string.
 *      If present, specifies the string delimiting the end of a quoted string.
 *      If not present, use syntax.beginquote as end quote.
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.beginquote2
 *  &lt;dd&gt;Alternative set of begin/end quotes.
 *
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.endquote2
 *  &lt;dd&gt;Alternative set of begin/end quotes.
 *
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.trimblanks
 *  &lt;dd&gt;If present, &quot;true&quot; means trim any leading and trailing whitespaces
 *      in a name component for comparison purposes. If its value is not
 *      &quot;true&quot;, or if the property is not present, blanks are significant.
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.separator.ava
 *  &lt;dd&gt;If present, specifies the string that separates
 *      attribute-value-assertions when specifying multiple attribute/value
 *      pairs. (e.g. &quot;,&quot;  in age=65,gender=male).
 *  &lt;dt&gt;jndi.syntax.separator.typeval
 *  &lt;dd&gt;If present, specifies the string that separators attribute
 *              from value (e.g. &quot;=&quot; in &quot;age=65&quot;)
 *&lt;/dl&gt;
 * These properties are interpreted according to the following rules:
 *&lt;ol&gt;
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * In a string without quotes or escapes, any instance of the
 * separator delimits two atomic names. Each atomic name is referred
 * to as a &lt;em&gt;component&lt;/em&gt;.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * A separator, quote or escape is escaped if preceded immediately
 * (on the left) by the escape.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * If there are two sets of quotes, a specific begin-quote must be matched
 * by its corresponding end-quote.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * A non-escaped begin-quote which precedes a component must be
 * matched by a non-escaped end-quote at the end of the component.
 * A component thus quoted is referred to as a
 * &lt;em&gt;quoted component&lt;/em&gt;. It is parsed by
 * removing the being- and end- quotes, and by treating the intervening
 * characters as ordinary characters unless one of the rules involving
 * quoted components listed below applies.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * Quotes embedded in non-quoted components are treated as ordinary strings
 * and need not be matched.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * A separator that is escaped or appears between non-escaped
 * quotes is treated as an ordinary string and not a separator.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * An escape string within a quoted component acts as an escape only when
 * followed by the corresponding end-quote string.
 * This can be used to embed an escaped quote within a quoted component.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * An escaped escape string is not treated as an escape string.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * An escape string that does not precede a meta string (quotes or separator)
 * and is not at the end of a component is treated as an ordinary string.
 *&lt;li&gt;
 * A leading separator (the compound name string begins with
 * a separator) denotes a leading empty atomic component (consisting
 * of an empty string).
 * A trailing separator (the compound name string ends with
 * a separator) denotes a trailing empty atomic component.
 * Adjacent separators denote an empty atomic component.
 *&lt;/ol&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The string form of the compound name follows the syntax described above.
 * When the components of the compound name are turned into their
 * string representation, the reserved syntax rules described above are
 * applied (e.g. embedded separators are escaped or quoted)
 * so that when the same string is parsed, it will yield the same components
 * of the original compound name.
 *
 *&lt;h1&gt;Multithreaded Access&lt;/h1&gt;
 * A &lt;tt&gt;CompoundName&lt;/tt&gt; instance is not synchronized against concurrent
 * multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a
 * &lt;tt&gt;CompoundName&lt;/tt&gt; should lock the object.
