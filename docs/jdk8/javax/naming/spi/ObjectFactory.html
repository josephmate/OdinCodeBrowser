/**
  * This interface represents a factory for creating an object.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The JNDI framework allows for object implementations to
  * be loaded in dynamically via &lt;em&gt;object factories&lt;/em&gt;.
  * For example, when looking up a printer bound in the name space,
  * if the print service binds printer names to References, the printer
  * Reference could be used to create a printer object, so that
  * the caller of lookup can directly operate on the printer object
  * after the lookup.
  * &lt;p&gt;An &lt;tt&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt; is responsible
  * for creating objects of a specific type.  In the above example,
  * you may have a PrinterObjectFactory for creating Printer objects.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * An object factory must implement the &lt;tt&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt; interface.
  * In addition, the factory class must be public and must have a
  * public constructor that accepts no parameters.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The &lt;tt&gt;getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; method of an object factory may
  * be invoked multiple times, possibly using different parameters.
  * The implementation is thread-safe.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The mention of URL in the documentation for this class refers to
  * a URL string as defined by RFC 1738 and its related RFCs. It is
  * any string that conforms to the syntax described therein, and
  * may not always have corresponding support in the java.net.URL
  * class or Web browsers.

public interface ObjectFactory {
/**
 * Creates an object using the location or reference information
 * specified.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Special requirements of this object are supplied
 * using &lt;code&gt;environment&lt;/code&gt;.
 * An example of such an environment property is user identity
 * information.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;tt&gt;NamingManager.getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt;
 * successively loads in object factories and invokes this method
 * on them until one produces a non-null answer.  When an exception
 * is thrown by an object factory, the exception is passed on to the caller
 * of &lt;tt&gt;NamingManager.getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt;
 * (and no search is made for other factories
 * that may produce a non-null answer).
 * An object factory should only throw an exception if it is sure that
 * it is the only intended factory and that no other object factories
 * should be tried.
 * If this factory cannot create an object using the arguments supplied,
 * it should return null.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * A &lt;em&gt;URL context factory&lt;/em&gt; is a special ObjectFactory that
 * creates contexts for resolving URLs or objects whose locations
 * are specified by URLs.  The &lt;tt&gt;getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; method
 * of a URL context factory will obey the following rules.
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; is null, create a context for resolving URLs of the
 * scheme associated with this factory. The resulting context is not tied
 * to a specific URL:  it is able to handle arbitrary URLs with this factory's
 * scheme id.  For example, invoking &lt;tt&gt;getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; with
 * &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; set to null on an LDAP URL context factory would return a
 * context that can resolve LDAP URLs
 * such as &quot;ldap://ldap.wiz.com/o=wiz,c=us&quot; and
 * &quot;ldap://ldap.umich.edu/o=umich,c=us&quot;.
 * &lt;li&gt;
 * If &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; is a URL string, create an object (typically a context)
 * identified by the URL.  For example, suppose this is an LDAP URL context
 * factory.  If &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;ldap://ldap.wiz.com/o=wiz,c=us&quot;,
 * getObjectInstance() would return the context named by the distinguished
 * name &quot;o=wiz, c=us&quot; at the LDAP server ldap.wiz.com.  This context can
 * then be used to resolve LDAP names (such as &quot;cn=George&quot;)
 * relative to that context.
 * &lt;li&gt;
 * If &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; is an array of URL strings, the assumption is that the
 * URLs are equivalent in terms of the context to which they refer.
 * Verification of whether the URLs are, or need to be, equivalent is up
 * to the context factory. The order of the URLs in the array is
 * not significant.
 * The object returned by getObjectInstance() is like that of the single
 * URL case.  It is the object named by the URLs.
 * &lt;li&gt;
 * If &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; is of any other type, the behavior of
 * &lt;tt&gt;getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; is determined by the context factory
 * implementation.
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;environment&lt;/tt&gt; parameters
 * are owned by the caller.
 * The implementation will not modify these objects or keep references
 * to them, although it may keep references to clones or copies.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;Name and Context Parameters.&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 * &lt;a name=NAMECTX&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 *
 * The &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt; parameters may
 * optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.
 * &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the object, relative to context
 * &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt;.
 * If there are several possible contexts from which the object
 * could be named -- as will often be the case -- it is up to
 * the caller to select one.  A good rule of thumb is to select the
 * &quot;deepest&quot; context available.
 * If &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt; is null, &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is relative
 * to the default initial context.  If no name is being specified, the
 * &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; parameter should be null.
 * If a factory uses &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt; it should synchronize its use
 * against concurrent access, since context implementations are not
 * guaranteed to be thread-safe.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *
 * @param obj The possibly null object containing location or reference
 *              information that can be used in creating an object.
 * @param name The name of this object relative to &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt;,
 *              or null if no name is specified.
 * @param nameCtx The context relative to which the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;
 *              parameter is specified, or null if &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is
 *              relative to the default initial context.
 * @param environment The possibly null environment that is used in
 *              creating the object.
 * @return The object created; null if an object cannot be created.
 * @exception Exception if this object factory encountered an exception
 * while attempting to create an object, and no other object factories are
 * to be tried.
