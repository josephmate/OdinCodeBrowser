/**
  * This interface represents a factory that creates an initial context.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The JNDI framework allows for different initial context implementations
  * to be specified at runtime.  The initial context is created using
  * an &lt;em&gt;initial context factory&lt;/em&gt;.
  * An initial context factory must implement the InitialContextFactory
  * interface, which provides a method for creating instances of initial
  * context that implement the Context interface.
  * In addition, the factory class must be public and must have a public
  * constructor that accepts no arguments.
