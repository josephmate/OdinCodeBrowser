/**
  * This interface represents a factory for creating an object given
  * an object and attributes about the object.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The JNDI framework allows for object implementations to
  * be loaded in dynamically via &lt;em&gt;object factories&lt;/em&gt;. See
  * &lt;tt&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt; for details.
  * &lt;p&gt;
  * A &lt;tt&gt;DirObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt; extends &lt;tt&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt; by allowing
  * an &lt;tt&gt;Attributes&lt;/tt&gt; instance
  * to be supplied to the &lt;tt&gt;getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; method.
  * &lt;tt&gt;DirObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt; implementations are intended to be used by &lt;tt&gt;DirContext&lt;/tt&gt;
  * service providers. The service provider, in addition reading an
  * object from the directory, might already have attributes that
  * are useful for the object factory to check to see whether the
  * factory is supposed to process the object. For instance, an LDAP-style
  * service provider might have read the &quot;objectclass&quot; of the object.
  * A CORBA object factory might be interested only in LDAP entries
  * with &quot;objectclass=corbaObject&quot;. By using the attributes supplied by
  * the LDAP service provider, the CORBA object factory can quickly
  * eliminate objects that it need not worry about, and non-CORBA object
  * factories can quickly eliminate CORBA-related LDAP entries.

public interface DirObjectFactory extends ObjectFactory {
/**
 * Creates an object using the location or reference information, and attributes
 * specified.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Special requirements of this object are supplied
 * using &lt;code&gt;environment&lt;/code&gt;.
 * An example of such an environment property is user identity
 * information.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryManager.getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt;
 * successively loads in object factories. If it encounters a &lt;tt&gt;DirObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt;,
 * it will invoke &lt;tt&gt;DirObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt;;
 * otherwise, it invokes
 * &lt;tt&gt;ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt;. It does this until a factory
 * produces a non-null answer.
 * &lt;p&gt; When an exception
 * is thrown by an object factory, the exception is passed on to the caller
 * of &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryManager.getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt;. The search for other factories
 * that may produce a non-null answer is halted.
 * An object factory should only throw an exception if it is sure that
 * it is the only intended factory and that no other object factories
 * should be tried.
 * If this factory cannot create an object using the arguments supplied,
 * it should return null.
  *&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;tt&gt;DirObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt; extends &lt;tt&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt;, it
  * effectively
  * has two &lt;tt&gt;getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; methods, where one differs from the other by
  * the attributes argument. Given a factory that implements &lt;tt&gt;DirObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt;,
  * &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryManager.getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; will only
  * use the method that accepts the attributes argument, while
  * &lt;tt&gt;NamingManager.getObjectInstance()&lt;/tt&gt; will only use the one that does not accept
  * the attributes argument.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * See &lt;tt&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt; for a description URL context factories and other
 * properties of object factories that apply equally to &lt;tt&gt;DirObjectFactory&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * The &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;attrs&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;environment&lt;/tt&gt; parameters
 * are owned by the caller.
 * The implementation will not modify these objects or keep references
 * to them, although it may keep references to clones or copies.
 *
 * @param obj The possibly null object containing location or reference
 *              information that can be used in creating an object.
 * @param name The name of this object relative to &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt;,
 *              or null if no name is specified.
 * @param nameCtx The context relative to which the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;
 *              parameter is specified, or null if &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is
 *              relative to the default initial context.
 * @param environment The possibly null environment that is used in
 *              creating the object.
 * @param attrs The possibly null attributes containing some of &lt;tt&gt;obj&lt;/tt&gt;'s
 * attributes. &lt;tt&gt;attrs&lt;/tt&gt; might not necessarily have all of &lt;tt&gt;obj&lt;/tt&gt;'s
 * attributes. If the object factory requires more attributes, it needs
 * to get it, either using &lt;tt&gt;obj&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;nameCtx&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *      The factory must not modify attrs.
 * @return The object created; null if an object cannot be created.
 * @exception Exception If this object factory encountered an exception
 * while attempting to create an object, and no other object factories are
 * to be tried.
