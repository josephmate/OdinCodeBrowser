/**
  * This interface represents a factory for obtaining the state of an
  * object and corresponding attributes for binding.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The JNDI framework allows for object implementations to
  * be loaded in dynamically via &lt;tt&gt;object factories&lt;/tt&gt;.
  * &lt;p&gt;
  * A &lt;tt&gt;DirStateFactory&lt;/tt&gt; extends &lt;tt&gt;StateFactory&lt;/tt&gt;
  * by allowing an &lt;tt&gt;Attributes&lt;/tt&gt; instance
  * to be supplied to and be returned by the &lt;tt&gt;getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt; method.
  * &lt;tt&gt;DirStateFactory&lt;/tt&gt; implementations are intended to be used by
  * &lt;tt&gt;DirContext&lt;/tt&gt; service providers.
  * When a caller binds an object using &lt;tt&gt;DirContext.bind()&lt;/tt&gt;,
  * he might also specify a set of attributes to be bound with the object.
  * The object and attributes to be bound are passed to
  * the &lt;tt&gt;getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt; method of a factory.
  * If the factory processes the object and attributes, it returns
  * a corresponding pair of object and attributes to be bound.
  * If the factory does not process the object, it must return null.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * For example, a caller might bind a printer object with some printer-related
  * attributes.
  *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
  * ctx.rebind(&quot;inky&quot;, printer, printerAttrs);
  *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  * An LDAP service provider for &lt;tt&gt;ctx&lt;/tt&gt; uses a &lt;tt&gt;DirStateFactory&lt;/tt&gt;
  * (indirectly via &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryManager.getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt;)
  * and gives it &lt;tt&gt;printer&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;printerAttrs&lt;/tt&gt;. A factory for
  * an LDAP directory might turn &lt;tt&gt;printer&lt;/tt&gt; into a set of attributes
  * and merge that with &lt;tt&gt;printerAttrs&lt;/tt&gt;. The service provider then
  * uses the resulting attributes to create an LDAP entry and updates
  * the directory.
  *
  * &lt;p&gt; Since &lt;tt&gt;DirStateFactory&lt;/tt&gt; extends &lt;tt&gt;StateFactory&lt;/tt&gt;, it
  * has two &lt;tt&gt;getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt; methods, where one
  * differs from the other by the attributes
  * argument. &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryManager.getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt; will only use
  * the form that accepts the attributes argument, while
  * &lt;tt&gt;NamingManager.getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt; will only use the form that
  * does not accept the attributes argument.
  *
  * &lt;p&gt; Either form of the &lt;tt&gt;getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt; method of a
  * DirStateFactory may be invoked multiple times, possibly using different
  * parameters.  The implementation is thread-safe.

/**
 * Retrieves the state of an object for binding given the object and attributes
 * to be transformed.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryManager.getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt;
 * successively loads in state factories. If a factory implements
 * &lt;tt&gt;DirStateFactory&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryManager&lt;/tt&gt; invokes this method;
 * otherwise, it invokes &lt;tt&gt;StateFactory.getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * It does this until a factory produces a non-null answer.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * When an exception is thrown by a factory,
 * the exception is passed on to the caller
 * of &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryManager.getStateToBind()&lt;/tt&gt;. The search for other factories
 * that may produce a non-null answer is halted.
 * A factory should only throw an exception if it is sure that
 * it is the only intended factory and that no other factories
 * should be tried.
 * If this factory cannot create an object using the arguments supplied,
 * it should return null.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt; parameters may
 * optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.
 * See the description of &quot;Name and Context Parameters&quot; in
 * {@link ObjectFactory#getObjectInstance ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()}
 * for details.
 * If a factory uses &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt; it should synchronize its use
 * against concurrent access, since context implementations are not
 * guaranteed to be thread-safe.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * The &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;inAttrs&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;environment&lt;/tt&gt; parameters
 * are owned by the caller.
 * The implementation will not modify these objects or keep references
 * to them, although it may keep references to clones or copies.
 * The object returned by this method is owned by the caller.
 * The implementation will not subsequently modify it.
 * It will contain either a new &lt;tt&gt;Attributes&lt;/tt&gt; object that is
 * likewise owned by the caller, or a reference to the original
 * &lt;tt&gt;inAttrs&lt;/tt&gt; parameter.
 *
 * @param obj A possibly null object whose state is to be retrieved.
 * @param name The name of this object relative to &lt;code&gt;nameCtx&lt;/code&gt;,
 *              or null if no name is specified.
 * @param nameCtx The context relative to which the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;
 *              parameter is specified, or null if &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is
 *              relative to the default initial context.
 * @param environment The possibly null environment to
 *              be used in the creation of the object's state.
 * @param inAttrs The possibly null attributes to be bound with the object.
 *      The factory must not modify &lt;tt&gt;inAttrs&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * @return A &lt;tt&gt;Result&lt;/tt&gt; containing the object's state for binding
 * and the corresponding
 * attributes to be bound; null if the object don't use this factory.
 * @exception NamingException If this factory encountered an exception
 * while attempting to get the object's state, and no other factories are
