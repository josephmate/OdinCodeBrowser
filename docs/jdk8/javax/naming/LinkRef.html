/**
  * This class represents a Reference whose contents is a name, called the link name,
  * that is bound to an atomic name in a context.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The name is a URL, or a name to be resolved relative to the initial
  * context, or if the first character of the name is &quot;.&quot;, the name
  * is relative to the context in which the link is bound.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * Normal resolution of names in context operations always follow links.
  * Resolution of the link name itself may cause resolution to pass through
  * other  links. This gives rise to the possibility of a cycle of links whose
  * resolution could not terminate normally. As a simple means to avoid such
  * non-terminating resolutions, service providers may define limits on the
  * number of links that may be involved in any single operation invoked
  * by the caller.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A LinkRef contains a single StringRefAddr, whose type is &quot;LinkAddress&quot;,
  * and whose contents is the link name. The class name field of the
  * Reference is that of this (LinkRef) class.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * LinkRef is bound to a name using the normal Context.bind()/rebind(), and
  * DirContext.bind()/rebind(). Context.lookupLink() is used to retrieve the link
  * itself if the terminal atomic name is bound to a link.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * Many naming systems support a native notion of link that may be used
  * within the naming system itself. JNDI does not specify whether
  * there is any relationship between such native links and JNDI links.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A LinkRef instance is not synchronized against concurrent access by multiple
  * threads. Threads that need to access a LinkRef instance concurrently should
  * synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking.
