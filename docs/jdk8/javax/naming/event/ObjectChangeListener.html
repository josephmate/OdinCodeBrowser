/**
  * Specifies the method that a listener of a &lt;tt&gt;NamingEvent&lt;/tt&gt;
  * with event type of &lt;tt&gt;OBJECT_CHANGED&lt;/tt&gt; must implement.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * An &lt;tt&gt;OBJECT_CHANGED&lt;/tt&gt; event type is fired when (the contents of)
  * an object has changed. This might mean that its attributes have been modified,
  * added, or removed, and/or that the object itself has been replaced.
  * How the object has changed can be determined by examining the
  * &lt;tt&gt;NamingEvent&lt;/tt&gt;'s old and new bindings.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A listener interested in &lt;tt&gt;OBJECT_CHANGED&lt;/tt&gt; event types must:
  *&lt;ol&gt;
  *
  *&lt;li&gt;Implement this interface and its method (&lt;tt&gt;objectChanged()&lt;/tt&gt;)
  *&lt;li&gt;Implement &lt;tt&gt;NamingListener.namingExceptionThrown()&lt;/tt&gt; so that
  * it will be notified of exceptions thrown while attempting to
  * collect information about the events.
  *&lt;li&gt;Register with the source using the source's &lt;tt&gt;addNamingListener()&lt;/tt&gt;
  *    method.
  *&lt;/ol&gt;
  * A listener that wants to be notified of namespace change events
  * should also implement the &lt;tt&gt;NamespaceChangeListener&lt;/tt&gt;
  * interface.
