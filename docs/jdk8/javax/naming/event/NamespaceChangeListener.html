  * with event types of &lt;tt&gt;OBJECT_ADDED&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;OBJECT_RENAMED&lt;/TT&gt;, or
  * &lt;TT&gt;OBJECT_REMOVED&lt;/TT&gt;.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * Such a listener must:
  *&lt;ol&gt;
  *&lt;li&gt;Implement this interface and its methods.
  *&lt;li&gt;Implement &lt;tt&gt;NamingListener.namingExceptionThrown()&lt;/tt&gt; so that
  * it will be notified of exceptions thrown while attempting to
  * collect information about the events.
  *&lt;li&gt;Register with the source using the source's &lt;tt&gt;addNamingListener()&lt;/tt&gt;
  *    method.

  * A listener that wants to be notified of &lt;tt&gt;OBJECT_CHANGED&lt;/tt&gt; event types
  * should also implement the &lt;tt&gt;ObjectChangeListener&lt;/tt&gt;
  * interface.
