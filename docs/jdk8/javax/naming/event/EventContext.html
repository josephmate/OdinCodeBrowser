/**
 * Contains methods for registering/deregistering listeners to be notified of
 * events fired when objects named in a context changes.
 *
 *&lt;h1&gt;Target&lt;/h1&gt;
 * The name parameter in the &lt;tt&gt;addNamingListener()&lt;/tt&gt; methods is referred
 * to as the &lt;em&gt;target&lt;/em&gt;. The target, along with the scope, identify
 * the object(s) that the listener is interested in.
 * It is possible to register interest in a target that does not exist, but
 * there might be limitations in the extent to which this can be
 * supported by the service provider and underlying protocol/service.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * If a service only supports registration for existing
 * targets, an attempt to register for a nonexistent target
 * results in a &lt;tt&gt;NameNotFoundException&lt;/tt&gt; being thrown as early as possible,
 * preferably at the time &lt;tt&gt;addNamingListener()&lt;/tt&gt; is called, or if that is
 * not possible, the listener will receive the exception through the
 * &lt;tt&gt;NamingExceptionEvent&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * Also, for service providers that only support registration for existing
 * targets, when the target that a listener has registered for is
 * subsequently removed from the namespace, the listener is notified
 * via a &lt;tt&gt;NamingExceptionEvent&lt;/tt&gt; (containing a
 *&lt;tt&gt;NameNotFoundException&lt;/tt&gt;).
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * An application can use the method &lt;tt&gt;targetMustExist()&lt;/tt&gt; to check
 * whether a &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; supports registration
 * of nonexistent targets.
 *
 *&lt;h1&gt;Event Source&lt;/h1&gt;
 * The &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; instance on which you invoke the
 * registration methods is the &lt;em&gt;event source&lt;/em&gt; of the events that are
 * (potentially) generated.
 * The source is &lt;em&gt;not necessarily&lt;/em&gt; the object named by the target.
 * Only when the target is the empty name is the object named by the target
 * the source.
 * In other words, the target,
 * along with the scope parameter, are used to identify
 * the object(s) that the listener is interested in, but the event source
 * is the &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; instance with which the listener
 * has registered.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * For example, suppose a listener makes the following registration:
 *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 *      NamespaceChangeListener listener = ...;
 *      src.addNamingListener(&quot;x&quot;, SUBTREE_SCOPE, listener);
 *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 * When an object named &quot;x/y&quot; is subsequently deleted, the corresponding
 * &lt;tt&gt;NamingEvent&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;evt&lt;/tt&gt;)  must contain:
 *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 *      evt.getEventContext() == src
 *      evt.getOldBinding().getName().equals(&quot;x/y&quot;)
 *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * Furthermore, listener registration/deregistration is with
 * the &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt;
 * &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt;, and not with the corresponding object in the namespace.
 * If the program intends at some point to remove a listener, then it needs to
 * keep a reference to the &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; instance on
 * which it invoked &lt;tt&gt;addNamingListener()&lt;/tt&gt; (just as
 * it needs to keep a reference to the listener in order to remove it
 * later). It cannot expect to do a &lt;tt&gt;lookup()&lt;/tt&gt; and get another instance of
 * a &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; on which to perform the deregistration.
 *&lt;h1&gt;Lifetime of Registration&lt;/h1&gt;
 * A registered listener becomes deregistered when:
 *&lt;ul&gt;
 *&lt;li&gt;It is removed using &lt;tt&gt;removeNamingListener()&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *&lt;li&gt;An exception is thrown while collecting information about the events.
 *  That is, when the listener receives a &lt;tt&gt;NamingExceptionEvent&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Context.close()&lt;/tt&gt; is invoked on the &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt;
 * instance with which it has registered.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 * Until that point, a &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; instance that has outstanding
 * listeners will continue to exist and be maintained by the service provider.
 *
 *&lt;h1&gt;Listener Implementations&lt;/h1&gt;
 * The registration/deregistration methods accept an instance of
 * &lt;tt&gt;NamingListener&lt;/tt&gt;. There are subinterfaces of &lt;tt&gt;NamingListener&lt;/tt&gt;
 * for different of event types of &lt;tt&gt;NamingEvent&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * For example, the &lt;tt&gt;ObjectChangeListener&lt;/tt&gt;
 * interface is for the &lt;tt&gt;NamingEvent.OBJECT_CHANGED&lt;/tt&gt; event type.
 * To register interest in multiple event types, the listener implementation
 * should implement multiple &lt;tt&gt;NamingListener&lt;/tt&gt; subinterfaces and use a
 * single invocation of &lt;tt&gt;addNamingListener()&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * In addition to reducing the number of method calls and possibly the code size
 * of the listeners, this allows some service providers to optimize the
 * registration.
 *
 *&lt;h1&gt;Threading Issues&lt;/h1&gt;
 *
 * Like &lt;tt&gt;Context&lt;/tt&gt; instances in general, instances of
 * &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; are not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
 * Care must be taken when multiple threads are accessing the same
 * &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; concurrently.
 * See the
 * &lt;a href=package-summary.html#THREADING&gt;package description&lt;/a&gt;
 * for more information on threading issues.
