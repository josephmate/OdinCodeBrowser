/**
 * This abstract class is used to represent a referral exception,
 * which is generated in response to a &lt;em&gt;referral&lt;/em&gt;
 * such as that returned by LDAP v3 servers.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A service provider provides
 * a subclass of &lt;tt&gt;ReferralException&lt;/tt&gt; by providing implementations
 * for &lt;tt&gt;getReferralInfo()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;getReferralContext()&lt;/tt&gt; (and appropriate
 * constructors and/or corresponding &quot;set&quot; methods).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The following code sample shows how &lt;tt&gt;ReferralException&lt;/tt&gt; can be used.
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;{@code
 *      while (true) {
 *          try {
 *              bindings = ctx.listBindings(name);
 *              while (bindings.hasMore()) {
 *                  b = bindings.next();
 *                  ...
 *              }
 *              break;
 *          } catch (ReferralException e) {
 *              ctx = e.getReferralContext();
 *          }
 *      }
 * }&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;tt&gt;ReferralException&lt;/tt&gt; is an abstract class. Concrete implementations
 * determine its synchronization and serialization properties.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * An environment parameter passed to the &lt;tt&gt;getReferralContext()&lt;/tt&gt;
 * method is owned by the caller.
 * The service provider will not modify the object or keep a reference to it,
 * but may keep a reference to a clone of it.
