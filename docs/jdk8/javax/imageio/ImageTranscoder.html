/**
 * An interface providing metadata transcoding capability.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Any image may be transcoded (written to a different format
 * than the one it was originally stored in) simply by performing
 * a read operation followed by a write operation.  However, loss
 * of data may occur in this process due to format differences.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; In general, the best results will be achieved when
 * format-specific metadata objects can be created to encapsulate as
 * much information about the image and its associated metadata as
 * possible, in terms that are understood by the specific
 * &lt;code&gt;ImageWriter&lt;/code&gt; used to perform the encoding.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; An &lt;code&gt;ImageTranscoder&lt;/code&gt; may be used to convert the
 * &lt;code&gt;IIOMetadata&lt;/code&gt; objects supplied by the
 * &lt;code&gt;ImageReader&lt;/code&gt; (representing per-stream and per-image
 * metadata) into corresponding objects suitable for encoding by a
 * particular &lt;code&gt;ImageWriter&lt;/code&gt;.  In the case where the methods
 * of this interface are being called directly on an
 * &lt;code&gt;ImageWriter&lt;/code&gt;, the output will be suitable for that
 * writer.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The internal details of converting an &lt;code&gt;IIOMetadata&lt;/code&gt;
 * object into a writer-specific format will vary according to the
 * context of the operation.  Typically, an &lt;code&gt;ImageWriter&lt;/code&gt;
 * will inspect the incoming object to see if it implements additional
 * interfaces with which the writer is familiar.  This might be the
 * case, for example, if the object was obtained by means of a read
 * operation on a reader plug-in written by the same vendor as the
 * writer.  In this case, the writer may access the incoming object by
 * means of its plug-in specific interfaces.  In this case, the
 * re-encoding may be close to lossless if the image file format is
 * kept constant.  If the format is changing, the writer may still
 * attempt to preserve as much information as possible.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; If the incoming object does not implement any additional
 * interfaces known to the writer, the writer has no choice but to
 * access it via the standard &lt;code&gt;IIOMetadata&lt;/code&gt; interfaces such
 * as the tree view provided by &lt;code&gt;IIOMetadata.getAsTree&lt;/code&gt;.
 * In this case, there is likely to be significant loss of
 * information.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; An independent &lt;code&gt;ImageTranscoder&lt;/code&gt; essentially takes
 * on the same role as the writer plug-in in the above examples.  It
 * must be familiar with the private interfaces used by both the
 * reader and writer plug-ins, and manually instantiate an object that
 * will be usable by the writer.  The resulting metadata objects may
 * be used by the writer directly.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; No independent implementations of &lt;code&gt;ImageTranscoder&lt;/code&gt;
 * are provided as part of the standard API.  Instead, the intention
 * of this interface is to provide a way for implementations to be
 * created and discovered by applications as the need arises.
