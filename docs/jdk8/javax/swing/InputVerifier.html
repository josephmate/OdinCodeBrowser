/**
 * The purpose of this class is to help clients support smooth focus
 * navigation through GUIs with text fields. Such GUIs often need
 * to ensure that the text entered by the user is valid (for example,
 * that it's in
 * the proper format) before allowing the user to navigate out of
 * the text field. To do this, clients create a subclass of
 * &lt;code&gt;InputVerifier&lt;/code&gt; and, using &lt;code&gt;JComponent&lt;/code&gt;'s
 * &lt;code&gt;setInputVerifier&lt;/code&gt; method,
 * attach an instance of their subclass to the &lt;code&gt;JComponent&lt;/code&gt; whose input they
 * want to validate. Before focus is transfered to another Swing component
 * that requests it, the input verifier's &lt;code&gt;shouldYieldFocus&lt;/code&gt; method is
 * called.  Focus is transfered only if that method returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The following example has two text fields, with the first one expecting
 * the string &quot;pass&quot; to be entered by the user. If that string is entered in
 * the first text field, then the user can advance to the second text field
 * either by clicking in it or by pressing TAB. However, if another string
 * is entered in the first text field, then the user will be unable to
 * transfer focus to the second text field.

 * // This program demonstrates the use of the Swing InputVerifier class.
