/**
 * &lt;p&gt;A painting delegate. The Painter interface defines exactly one method,
 * &lt;code&gt;paint&lt;/code&gt;. It is used in situations where the developer can change
 * the painting routine of a component without having to resort to subclassing
 * the component. It is also generically useful when doing any form of painting
 * delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt;s are simply encapsulations of Java2D code and make
 * it fairly trivial to reuse existing &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt;s or to combine
 * them together. Implementations of this interface are also trivial to write,
 * such that if you can't find a &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; that does what you need,
 * you can write one with minimal effort. Writing a &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; requires
 * knowledge of Java2D.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; may be created with a type parameter. This type will be
 * expected in the &lt;code&gt;paint&lt;/code&gt; method. For example, you may wish to write a
 * &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; that only works with subclasses of {@link java.awt.Component}.
 * In that case, when the &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; is declared, you may declare that
 * it requires a &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt;, allowing the paint method to be type safe. Ex:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * {@code
 * Painter&lt;Component&gt; p = new Painter&lt;Component&gt;() {
 *     public void paint(Graphics2D g, Component c, int width, int height) {
 *         g.setColor(c.getBackground());
 *         //and so forth
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface makes no guarantees of threadsafety.&lt;/p&gt;

public interface Painter&lt;T&gt; {
    /**
     * &lt;p&gt;Renders to the given {@link java.awt.Graphics2D} object. Implementations
     * of this method &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; modify state on the &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt;, and are not
     * required to restore that state upon completion. In most cases, it is recommended
     * that the caller pass in a scratch graphics object. The &lt;code&gt;Graphics2D&lt;/code&gt;
     * must never be null.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;State on the graphics object may be honored by the &lt;code&gt;paint&lt;/code&gt; method,
     * but may not be. For instance, setting the antialiasing rendering hint on the
     * graphics may or may not be respected by the &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;The supplied object parameter acts as an optional configuration argument.
     * For example, it could be of type &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt;
     * that expected it could then read state from that &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt; and
     * use the state for painting. For example, an implementation may read the
     * backgroundColor and use that.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;Generally, to enhance reusability, most standard &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt;s ignore
     * this parameter. They can thus be reused in any context. The &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;
     * may be null. Implementations must not throw a NullPointerException if the object
     * parameter is null.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; arguments specify the
     * width and height that the &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; should paint into. More
     * specifically, the specified width and height instruct the painter that it should
     * paint fully within this width and height. Any specified clip on the
     * &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; param will further constrain the region.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;For example, suppose I have a &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; implementation that draws
     * a gradient. The gradient goes from white to black. It &quot;stretches&quot; to fill the
     * painted region. Thus, if I use this &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; to paint a 500 x 500
     * region, the far left would be black, the far right would be white, and a smooth
     * gradient would be painted between. I could then, without modification, reuse the
     * &lt;code&gt;Painter&lt;/code&gt; to paint a region that is 20x20 in size. This region would
     * also be black on the left, white on the right, and a smooth gradient painted
     * between.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * @param g The Graphics2D to render to. This must not be null.
     * @param object an optional configuration parameter. This may be null.
     * @param width width of the area to paint.
     * @param height height of the area to paint.
