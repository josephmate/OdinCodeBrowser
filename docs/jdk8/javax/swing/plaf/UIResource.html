/**
 * This interface is used to mark objects created by ComponentUI delegates.
 * The &lt;code&gt;ComponentUI.installUI()&lt;/code&gt; and
 * &lt;code&gt;ComponentUI.uninstallUI()&lt;/code&gt; methods can use this interface
 * to decide if a properties value has been overridden.  For example, the
 * JList cellRenderer property is initialized by BasicListUI.installUI(),
 * only if it's initial value is null:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * if (list.getCellRenderer() == null) {
 *     list.setCellRenderer((ListCellRenderer)(UIManager.get(&quot;List.cellRenderer&quot;)));
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * At uninstallUI() time we reset the property to null if its value
 * is an instance of UIResource:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * if (list.getCellRenderer() instanceof UIResource) {
 *     list.setCellRenderer(null);
 * }
 *&lt;/pre&gt;
 * This pattern applies to all properties except the java.awt.Component
 * properties font, foreground, and background.  If one of these
 * properties isn't initialized, or is explicitly set to null,
 * its container provides the value.  For this reason the
 * &lt;code&gt;&quot;== null&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is unreliable when installUI() is called
 * to dynamically change a components look and feel.  So at installUI()
 * time we check to see if the current value is a UIResource:
 *&lt;pre&gt;
 * if (!(list.getFont() instanceof UIResource)) {
 *     list.setFont(UIManager.getFont(&quot;List.font&quot;));
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
