 * An &lt;code&gt;AWTEvent&lt;/code&gt; that adds support for

 * although different IDs are used.
 * Help on handling internal frame events
 * is in
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/internalframelistener.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;How to Write an Internal Frame Listener&lt;/a&gt;,
 * a section in &lt;em&gt;The Java Tutorial&lt;/em&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt;
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 * the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 * of all JavaBeans&amp;trade;
 * has been added to the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package.
 * Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}.
