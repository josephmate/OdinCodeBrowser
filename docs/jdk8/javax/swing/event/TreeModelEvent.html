    /**
     * Used to create an event when nodes have been changed, inserted, or
     * removed, identifying the path to the parent of the modified items as
     * an array of Objects. All of the modified objects are siblings which are
     * direct descendents (not grandchildren) of the specified parent.
     * The positions at which the inserts, deletes, or changes occurred are
     * specified by an array of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. The indexes in that array
     * must be in order, from lowest to highest.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * For changes, the indexes in the model correspond exactly to the indexes
     * of items currently displayed in the UI. As a result, it is not really
     * critical if the indexes are not in their exact order. But after multiple
     * inserts or deletes, the items currently in the UI no longer correspond
     * to the items in the model. It is therefore critical to specify the
     * indexes properly for inserts and deletes.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * For inserts, the indexes represent the &lt;i&gt;final&lt;/i&gt; state of the tree,
     * after the inserts have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in
     * order, the most natural processing methodology is to do the inserts
     * starting at the lowest index and working towards the highest. Accumulate
     * a Vector of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; objects that specify the
     * insert-locations as you go, then convert the Vector to an
     * array of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; to create the event. When the postition-index
     * equals zero, the node is inserted at the beginning of the list. When the
     * position index equals the size of the list, the node is &quot;inserted&quot; at
     * (appended to) the end of the list.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * For deletes, the indexes represent the &lt;i&gt;initial&lt;/i&gt; state of the tree,
     * before the deletes have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in
     * order, the most natural processing methodology is to use a delete-counter.
     * Start by initializing the counter to zero and start work through the
     * list from lowest to highest. Every time you do a delete, add the current
     * value of the delete-counter to the index-position where the delete occurred,
     * and append the result to a Vector of delete-locations, using
     * &lt;code&gt;addElement()&lt;/code&gt;. Then increment the delete-counter. The index
     * positions stored in the Vector therefore reflect the effects of all previous
     * deletes, so they represent each object's position in the initial tree.
     * (You could also start at the highest index and working back towards the
     * lowest, accumulating a Vector of delete-locations as you go using the
     * &lt;code&gt;insertElementAt(Integer, 0)&lt;/code&gt;.) However you produce the Vector
     * of initial-positions, you then need to convert the Vector of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;
     * objects to an array of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; to create the event.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * &lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type:none&quot;&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;Like the &lt;code&gt;insertNodeInto&lt;/code&gt; method in the
     *    &lt;code&gt;DefaultTreeModel&lt;/code&gt; class, &lt;code&gt;insertElementAt&lt;/code&gt;
     *    appends to the &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; when the index matches the size
     *    of the vector. So you can use &lt;code&gt;insertElementAt(Integer, 0)&lt;/code&gt;
     *    even when the vector is empty.&lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;To create a node changed event for the root node, specify the parent
     *     and the child indices as &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
