/**
 * TableModelEvent is used to notify listeners that a table model
 * has changed. The model event describes changes to a TableModel
 * and all references to rows and columns are in the co-ordinate
 * system of the model.
 * Depending on the parameters used in the constructors, the TableModelevent
 * can be used to specify the following types of changes:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * TableModelEvent(source);              //  The data, ie. all rows changed
 * TableModelEvent(source, HEADER_ROW);  //  Structure change, reallocate TableColumns
 * TableModelEvent(source, 1);           //  Row 1 changed
 * TableModelEvent(source, 3, 6);        //  Rows 3 to 6 inclusive changed
 * TableModelEvent(source, 2, 2, 6);     //  Cell at (2, 6) changed
 * TableModelEvent(source, 3, 6, ALL_COLUMNS, INSERT); // Rows (3, 6) were inserted
 * TableModelEvent(source, 3, 6, ALL_COLUMNS, DELETE); // Rows (3, 6) were deleted
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * It is possible to use other combinations of the parameters, not all of them
 * are meaningful. By subclassing, you can add other information, for example:
 * whether the event WILL happen or DID happen. This makes the specification
 * of rows in DELETE events more useful but has not been included in
 * the swing package as the JTable only needs post-event notification.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt;
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 * the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 * of all JavaBeans&amp;trade;
 * has been added to the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package.
 * Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}.
