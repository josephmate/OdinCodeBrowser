/**
 * An &lt;code&gt;UndoableEdit&lt;/code&gt; represents an edit.  The edit may
 * be undone, or if already undone the edit may be redone.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;code&gt;UndoableEdit&lt;/code&gt; is designed to be used with the
 * &lt;code&gt;UndoManager&lt;/code&gt;.  As &lt;code&gt;UndoableEdit&lt;/code&gt;s are generated
 * by an &lt;code&gt;UndoableEditListener&lt;/code&gt; they are typically added to
 * the &lt;code&gt;UndoManager&lt;/code&gt;.  When an &lt;code&gt;UndoableEdit&lt;/code&gt;
 * is added to an &lt;code&gt;UndoManager&lt;/code&gt; the following occurs (assuming
 * &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; has not been called on the &lt;code&gt;UndoManager&lt;/code&gt;):
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;UndoManager&lt;/code&gt; contains edits it will call
 *     &lt;code&gt;addEdit&lt;/code&gt; on the current edit passing in the new edit
 *     as the argument.  If &lt;code&gt;addEdit&lt;/code&gt; returns true the
 *     new edit is assumed to have been incorporated into the current edit and
 *     the new edit will not be added to the list of current edits.
 *     Edits can use &lt;code&gt;addEdit&lt;/code&gt; as a way for smaller edits to
 *     be incorporated into a larger edit and treated as a single edit.
 * &lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;addEdit&lt;/code&gt; returns false &lt;code&gt;replaceEdit&lt;/code&gt;
 *     is called on the new edit with the current edit passed in as the
 *     argument. This is the inverse of &lt;code&gt;addEdit&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#151;
 *     if the new edit returns true from &lt;code&gt;replaceEdit&lt;/code&gt;, the new
 *     edit replaces the current edit.
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * The &lt;code&gt;UndoManager&lt;/code&gt; makes use of
 * &lt;code&gt;isSignificant&lt;/code&gt; to determine how many edits should be
 * undone or redone.  The &lt;code&gt;UndoManager&lt;/code&gt; will undo or redo
 * all insignificant edits (&lt;code&gt;isSignificant&lt;/code&gt; returns false)
 * between the current edit and the last or
 * next significant edit.   &lt;code&gt;addEdit&lt;/code&gt; and
 * &lt;code&gt;replaceEdit&lt;/code&gt; can be used to treat multiple edits as
 * a single edit, returning false from &lt;code&gt;isSignificant&lt;/code&gt;
 * allows for treating can be used to
 * have many smaller edits undone or redone at once.  Similar functionality
 * can also be done using the &lt;code&gt;addEdit&lt;/code&gt; method.
