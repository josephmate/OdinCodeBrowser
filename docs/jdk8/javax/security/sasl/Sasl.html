/**
 * A static class for creating SASL clients and servers.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * This class defines the policy of how to locate, load, and instantiate
 * SASL clients and servers.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * For example, an application or library gets a SASL client by doing
 * something like:
 *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 * SaslClient sc = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechanisms,
 *     authorizationId, protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);
 *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 * It can then proceed to use the instance to create an authentication connection.
 *&lt;p&gt;
 * Similarly, a server gets a SASL server by using code that looks as follows:
 *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 * SaslServer ss = Sasl.createSaslServer(mechanism,
 *     protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);
 *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
