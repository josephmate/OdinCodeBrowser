/**
 * Class JobName is a printing attribute class, a text attribute, that specifies
 * the name of a print job. A job's name is an arbitrary string defined by the
 * client. It does not need to be unique between different jobs. A Print Job's
 * JobName attribute is set to the value supplied by the client in the Print
 * Request's attribute set. If, however, the client does not supply a JobName
 * attribute in the Print Request, the printer, when it creates the Print Job,
 * must generate a JobName. The printer should generate the value of the Print
 * Job's JobName attribute from the first of the following sources that produces
 * a value: (1) the {@link DocumentName DocumentName} attribute of the first (or
 * only) doc in the job, (2) the URL of the first (or only) doc in the job, if
 * the doc's print data representation object is a URL, or (3) any other piece
 * of Print Job specific and/or document content information.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 * locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
 * &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute name.
