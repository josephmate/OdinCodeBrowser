/**
 * Class JobImpressionsCompleted is an integer valued printing attribute class
 * that specifies the number of impressions completed for the job so far. For
 * printing devices, the impressions completed includes interpreting, marking,
 * and stacking the output.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The JobImpressionsCompleted attribute describes the progress of the job. This
 * attribute is intended to be a counter. That is, the JobImpressionsCompleted
 * value for a job that has not started processing must be 0. When the job's
 * {@link JobState JobState} is PROCESSING or PROCESSING_STOPPED, the
 * JobImpressionsCompleted value is intended to increase as the job is
 * processed; it indicates the amount of the job that has been processed at the
 * time the Print Job's attribute set is queried or at the time a print job
 * event is reported. When the job enters the COMPLETED, CANCELED, or ABORTED
 * states, the JobImpressionsCompleted value is the final value for the job.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 * category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute
 * name.
