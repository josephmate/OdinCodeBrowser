/**
 * Class JobImpressions is an integer valued printing attribute class that
 * specifies the total size in number of impressions of the document(s) being
 * submitted. An &quot;impression&quot; is the image (possibly many print-stream pages in
 * different configurations) imposed onto a single media page.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The JobImpressions attribute describes the size of the job. This attribute is
 * not intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful routing and
 * scheduling information if known. The printer may try to compute the
 * JobImpressions attribute's value if it is not supplied in the Print Request.
 * Even if the client does supply a value for the JobImpressions attribute in
 * the Print Request, the printer may choose to change the value if the printer
 * is able to compute a value which is more accurate than the client supplied
 * value. The printer may be able to determine the correct value for the
 * JobImpressions attribute either right at job submission time or at any later
 * point in time.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * As with {@link JobKOctets JobKOctets}, the JobImpressions value must not
 * include the multiplicative factors contributed by the number of copies
 * specified by the {@link Copies Copies} attribute, independent of whether the
 * device can process multiple copies without making multiple passes over the
 * job or document data and independent of whether the output is collated or
 * not. Thus the value is independent of the implementation and reflects the
 * size of the document(s) measured in impressions independent of the number of
 * copies.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * As with {@link JobKOctets JobKOctets}, the JobImpressions value must also not
 * include the multiplicative factor due to a copies instruction embedded in the
 * document data. If the document data actually includes replications of the
 * document data, this value will include such replication. In other words, this
 * value is always the number of impressions in the source document data, rather
 * than a measure of the number of impressions to be produced by the job.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 * category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute
 * name.
