/**
 * Class OutputDeviceAssigned is a printing attribute class, a text attribute,
 * that identifies the output device to which the service has assigned this
 * job. If an output device implements an embedded Print Service instance, the
 * printer need not set this attribute. If a print server implements a
 * Print Service instance, the value may be empty (zero- length string) or not
 * returned until the service assigns an output device to the job. This
 * attribute is particularly useful when a single service supports multiple
 * devices (so called &quot;fan-out&quot;).
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 * locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
 * &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute name.
