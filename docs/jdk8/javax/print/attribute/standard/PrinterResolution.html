/**
 * Class PrinterResolution is a printing attribute class that specifies an
 * exact resolution supported by a printer or to be used for a print job.
 * This attribute assumes that printers have a small set of device resolutions
 * at which they can operate rather than a continuum.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * PrinterResolution is used in multiple ways:
 * &lt;OL TYPE=1&gt;
 * &lt;LI&gt;
 * When a client searches looking for a printer that supports the client's
 * desired resolution exactly (no more, no less), the client specifies
 * an instance of class PrinterResolution indicating the exact resolution the
 * client wants. Only printers supporting that exact resolution will match the
 * search.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;LI&gt;
 * When a client needs to print a job using the client's desired resolution
 * exactly (no more, no less), the client specifies an instance of class
 * PrinterResolution as an attribute of the Print Job. This will fail if the
 * Print Job doesn't support that exact resolution, and Fidelity is set to
 * true.
 * &lt;/OL&gt;
 * If a client wants to locate a printer supporting a resolution
 * greater than some required minimum, then it may be necessary to exclude
 * this attribute from a lookup request and to directly query the set of
 * supported resolutions, and specify the one that most closely meets
 * the client's requirements.
 * In some cases this may be more simply achieved by specifying a
 * PrintQuality attribute which often controls resolution.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The information needed to construct an IPP
 * &lt;CODE&gt;&quot;printer-resolution&quot;&lt;/CODE&gt; attribute can be obtained by calling
 * methods on the PrinterResolution object. The category name returned by
 * &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute name.
