 * To construct a DateTimeAtCompleted attribute from separate values of the
 * year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, use a {@link java.util.Calendar
 * Calendar} object to construct a {@link java.util.Date Date} object, then use
 * the {@link java.util.Date Date} object to construct the DateTimeAtCompleted
