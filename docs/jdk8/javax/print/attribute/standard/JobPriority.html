/**
 * Class JobPriority is an integer valued printing attribute class that
 * specifies a print job's priority.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * If a JobPriority attribute is specified for a Print Job, it specifies a
 * priority for scheduling the job. A higher value specifies a higher priority.
 * The value 1 indicates the lowest possible priority. The value 100 indicates
 * the highest possible priority. Among those jobs that are ready to print, a
 * printer must print all jobs with a priority value of &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt; before printing
 * those with a priority value of &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;-1 for all &lt;I&gt;n.&lt;/I&gt;
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * If the client does not specify a JobPriority attribute for a Print Job and
 * the printer does support the JobPriority attribute, the printer must use an
 * implementation-defined default JobPriority value.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The client can always specify any job priority value from 1 to 100 for a job.
 * However, a Print Service instance may support fewer than 100 different
 * job priority levels. If this is the case, the Print Service instance
 * automatically maps the client-specified job priority value to one of the
 * supported job priority levels, dividing the 100 job priority values equally
 * among the available job priority levels.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 * category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute
 * name.
