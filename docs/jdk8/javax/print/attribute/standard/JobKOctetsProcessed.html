/**
 * Class JobKOctetsProcessed is an integer valued printing attribute class that
 * specifies the total number of print data octets processed so far in K octets,
 * i.e., in units of 1024 octets. The value must be rounded up, so that a job
 * between 1 and 1024 octets inclusive must be indicated as being 1K octets,
 * 1025 to 2048 inclusive must be 2K, etc. For a multidoc print job (a job with
 * multiple documents), the JobKOctetsProcessed value is computed by adding up
 * the individual documents' number of octets processed so far, then rounding up
 * to the next K octets value.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The JobKOctetsProcessed attribute describes the progress of the job. This
 * attribute is intended to be a counter. That is, the JobKOctetsProcessed value
 * for a job that has not started processing must be 0. When the job's {@link
 * JobState JobState} is PROCESSING or PROCESSING_STOPPED, the
 * JobKOctetsProcessed value is intended to increase as the job is processed; it
 * indicates the amount of the job that has been processed at the time the Print
 * Job's attribute set is queried or at the time a print job event is reported.
 * When the job enters the COMPLETED, CANCELED, or ABORTED states, the
 * JobKOctetsProcessed value is the final value for the job.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * For implementations where multiple copies are produced by the interpreter
 * with only a single pass over the data, the final value of the
 * JobKOctetsProcessed attribute must be equal to the value of the {@link
 * JobKOctets JobKOctets} attribute. For implementations where multiple copies
 * are produced by the interpreter by processing the data for each copy, the
 * final value must be a multiple of the value of the {@link JobKOctets
 * JobKOctets} attribute.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 * category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute
 * name.
