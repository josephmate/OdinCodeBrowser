/**
 * Class JobHoldUntil is a printing attribute class, a date-time attribute, that
 * specifies the exact date and time at which the job must become a candidate
 * for printing.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * If the value of this attribute specifies a date-time that is in the future,
 * the printer should add the {@link JobStateReason JobStateReason} value of
 * JOB_HOLD_UNTIL_SPECIFIED to the job's {@link JobStateReasons JobStateReasons}
 * attribute, must move the job to the PENDING_HELD state, and must not schedule
 * the job for printing until the specified date-time arrives.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * When the specified date-time arrives, the printer must remove the {@link
 * JobStateReason JobStateReason} value of JOB_HOLD_UNTIL_SPECIFIED from the
 * job's {@link JobStateReasons JobStateReasons} attribute, if present. If there
 * are no other job state reasons that keep the job in the PENDING_HELD state,
 * the printer must consider the job as a candidate for processing by moving the
 * job to the PENDING state.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * If the specified date-time has already passed, the job must be a candidate
 * for processing immediately. Thus, one way to make the job immediately become
 * a candidate for processing is to specify a JobHoldUntil attribute constructed
 * like this (denoting a date-time of January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT):
 * &lt;PRE&gt;
 *     JobHoldUntil immediately = new JobHoldUntil (new Date (0L));
 * &lt;/PRE&gt;
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * If the client does not supply this attribute in a Print Request and the
 * printer supports this attribute, the printer must use its
 * (implementation-dependent) default JobHoldUntil value at job submission time
 * (unlike most job template attributes that are used if necessary at job
 * processing time).
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * To construct a JobHoldUntil attribute from separate values of the year,
 * month, day, hour, minute, and so on, use a {@link java.util.Calendar
 * Calendar} object to construct a {@link java.util.Date Date} object, then use
 * the {@link java.util.Date Date} object to construct the JobHoldUntil
 * attribute. To convert a JobHoldUntil attribute to separate values of the
 * year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, create a {@link java.util.Calendar
 * Calendar} object and set it to the {@link java.util.Date Date} from the
 * JobHoldUntil attribute.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; Although IPP supports a &quot;job-hold-until&quot; attribute
 * specified as a keyword, IPP does not at this time support a &quot;job-hold-until&quot;
 * attribute specified as a date and time. However, the date and time can be
 * converted to one of the standard IPP keywords with some loss of precision;
 * for example, a JobHoldUntil value with today's date and 9:00pm local time
 * might be converted to the standard IPP keyword &quot;night&quot;. The category name
 * returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute name.
