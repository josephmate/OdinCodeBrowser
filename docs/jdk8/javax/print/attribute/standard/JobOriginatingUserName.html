 * Class JobOriginatingUserName is a printing attribute class, a text
 * attribute, that contains the name of the end user that submitted the
 * print job. If possible, the printer sets this attribute to the most
 * authenticated printable user name that it can obtain from the
 * authentication service that authenticated the submitted Print Request.
 * If such is not available, the printer uses the value of the
 * {@link RequestingUserName RequestingUserName}
 * attribute supplied by the client in the Print Request's attribute set.
 * If no authentication service is available, and the client did not supply
 * a {@link RequestingUserName RequestingUserName} attribute,
 * the printer sets the JobOriginatingUserName attribute to an empty
 * (zero-length) string.
