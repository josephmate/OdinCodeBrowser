/**
 * Class JobPrioritySupported is an integer valued printing attribute class
 * that specifies whether a Print Service instance supports the {@link
 * JobPriority JobPriority} attribute and the number of different job priority
 * levels supported.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The client can always specify any {@link JobPriority JobPriority} value
 * from 1 to 100 for a job. However, the Print Service instance may support
 * fewer than 100 different job priority levels. If this is the case, the
 * Print Service instance automatically maps the client-specified job priority
 * value to one of the supported job priority levels, dividing the 100 job
 * priority values equally among the available job priority levels.
 * &lt;P&gt;

 * The category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP
