/**
 * Class RequestingUserName is a printing attribute class, a text attribute,
 * that specifies the name of the end user that submitted the print job. A
 * requesting user name is an arbitrary string defined by the client. The
 * printer does not put the client-specified RequestingUserName attribute into
 * the Print Job's attribute set; rather, the printer puts in a {@link
 * JobOriginatingUserName JobOriginatingUserName} attribute.
 * This means that services which support specifying a username with this
 * attribute should also report a JobOriginatingUserName in the job's
 * attribute set. Note that many print services may have a way to independently
 * authenticate the user name, and so may state support for a
 * requesting user name, but in practice will then report the user name
 * authenticated by the service rather than that specified via this
 * attribute.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 * locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
 * &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP attribute name.
