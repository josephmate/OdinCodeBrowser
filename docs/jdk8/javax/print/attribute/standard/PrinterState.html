/**
 * Class PrinterState is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that
 * identifies the current state of a printer. Class PrinterState defines
 * standard printer state values. A Print Service implementation only needs
 * to report those printer states which are appropriate for the particular
 * implementation; it does not have to report every defined printer state. The
 * {@link PrinterStateReasons PrinterStateReasons} attribute augments the
 * PrinterState attribute to give more detailed information about the printer
 * in  given printer state.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The category name returned by
 * &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; is the IPP attribute name.  The enumeration's
 * integer value is the IPP enum value.  The &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method
 * returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.
