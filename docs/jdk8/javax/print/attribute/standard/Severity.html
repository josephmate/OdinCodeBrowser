/**
 * Class Severity is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that denotes
 * the severity of a {@link PrinterStateReason PrinterStateReason} attribute.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Instances of Severity do not appear in a Print Service's attribute set
 * directly. Rather, a {@link PrinterStateReasons PrinterStateReasons}
 * attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set.
 *  The {@link PrinterStateReasons
 * PrinterStateReasons} attribute contains zero, one, or more than one {@link
 * PrinterStateReason PrinterStateReason} objects which pertain to the Print
 * Service's status, and each {@link PrinterStateReason PrinterStateReason}
 * object is associated with a Severity level of REPORT (least severe),
 * WARNING, or ERROR (most severe).
 * The printer adds a {@link PrinterStateReason
 * PrinterStateReason} object to the Print Service's
 * {@link PrinterStateReasons PrinterStateReasons} attribute when the
 * corresponding condition becomes true
 * of the printer, and the printer removes the {@link PrinterStateReason
 * PrinterStateReason} object again when the corresponding condition becomes
 * false, regardless of whether the Print Service's overall
 * {@link PrinterState PrinterState} also changed.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt;
 * &lt;code&gt;Severity.toString()&lt;/code&gt; returns either &quot;error&quot;, &quot;warning&quot;, or
 * &quot;report&quot;.  The string values returned by
 * each individual {@link PrinterStateReason} and
 * associated {@link Severity} object's &lt;CODE&gt;toString()&lt;/CODE&gt;
 * methods, concatenated together with a hyphen (&lt;CODE&gt;&quot;-&quot;&lt;/CODE&gt;) in
 * between, gives the IPP keyword value for a {@link PrinterStateReasons}.
 * The category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP
 * attribute name.
